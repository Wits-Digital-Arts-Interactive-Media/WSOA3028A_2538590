                <h3>Graphic Design</h3>
                <p> These are some of the graphic design works I made. As you can see, these include product design and poster design. I 
                managed to make these with 1 year of experience with Adobe Photoshop. I really hope to continue to grow and improve my 
                skills.</p>

                <h3>Interior Design</h3>
                <p> These are my Interior and Architectural designs. I have a thing for buildings and their functionality and what can be 
                done to any empty room to make it more aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly for the people who occupy the space. Each 
                environment has a story to tell.</p>
