            <p>I would want to structure my home page like this, with user interface buttons that help the user navigate through the website just from clicking. I want to include an image of myself but Iâ€™m also considering putting a silhouette of myself, like the image portrays. I would also want to include a quote about Interactivity just as an icebreaker.</p>

                <p>I really like the way the text of this website is laid out, as well as the images. I drew inspiration from this to make my wireframe for the 'About Me' section.</p>

        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <p>I am thinking of using modern minimalistic fonts such as Montserrat and Jura, to give the website a more clear and crisp appearance, making it legible.</p>

        <figure> 
            <a href = " https://localfonts.eu/freefonts/bulgarian-cyrillic/montserrat/">Local fonts (Montserrat) </a>
            <p> Montserrat</p>
            <img src = "../Images/Montserrat.png" alt="Image of Montserrat font example" width = "700" height = "460">
        </figure>

        <figure>
            <a href = "https://localfonts.eu/freefonts/traditional-cyrillic-free-fonts/jura/"> Local Fonts (Jura)</a>
            <p> Jura</p>
            <img src = "../Images/jura.jpg" alt = "Image of Jura font example" width = "700" height = "460">
        </figure>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Modern Aesthetic: Montserrat and Jura are both modern sans-serif fonts. Sans-serif fonts are often chosen for their clean and 
            contemporary appearance. They lack the decorative strokes (serifs) at the ends of characters, which gives them a sleek and minimalistic 
            look. This modern aesthetic helps the website to appear up-to-date and in line with current design trends.</li>
            <li>Minimalism: These fonts embody minimalism, which is characterized by simplicity and clarity. Minimalist design focuses on essential 
            elements and eliminates unnecessary distractions. Montserrat and Jura have clean lines and uniform stroke widths, contributing to a 
            clutter-free visual experience. In web design, minimalism can enhance user focus and readability by reducing visual noise.</li>
            <li>Legibility: Legibility refers to how easily text can be read. Montserrat and Jura are highly legible fonts, especially in digital 
            environments. Their clear letterforms and ample spacing between characters ensure that text is easy to read, even at smaller sizes 
            or on screens with varying resolutions. </li>
            <li> Consistency: Both Montserrat and Jura offer a variety of font weights and styles. Consistent typography creates visual harmony. 
            By using these fonts consistently for headings, body text, and other elements, I will be able to establish a cohesive design language 
            that guides users through my site seamlessly.</li>
            <li> Versatility: While Montserrat and Jura are distinct fonts, they complement each other well. Montserrat is often used for headings and 
            titles due to its bold and attention-grabbing style, while Jura's lighter weight and narrower proportions make it suitable for body text and 
            smaller elements. </li>

        <h2> Colours: </h2>
        <img src = "../Images/Colours1.jpg" alt = "Colours" width = "500" height = "400">
        <p> My first colour palette consists of the colours: YInMn Blue, Columbia Blue, Lemon Chiffon, Black, and Ivory in my website's colour palette. </p>
        <ul>
            <li> YInMn Blue: This is a vibrant and attention-grabbing shade of blue. Its unique quality is its brightness and richness, which 
            can evoke feelings of trust, stability, and professionalism. Blue is often associated with reliability and calmness, making it 
            suitable for making the website convey trustworthiness and authority. YInMn Blue can give the website a modern and sophisticated 
            feel due to its novelty and intensity. </li>
            <li> Columbia Blue: Columbia Blue is a lighter shade of blue. It's soothing and easy on the eyes, evoking feelings of tranquillity 
            and openness. Lighter blues like Columbia Blue often create a sense of spaciousness and airiness, which will help my website feel 
            more inviting and comfortable for users to navigate. This colour also complements the YInMn Blue well, providing a softer contrast 
            while maintaining a cohesive colour scheme.</li>
            <li>Lemon Chiffon: Lemon Chiffon is a warm, light yellow colour. Yellow is associated with happiness, optimism, and energy. Lemon 
            Chiffon specifically has a softness to it that can add warmth and friendliness to my website. Incorporating this colour can bring a 
            cheerful and uplifting vibe, which is especially useful to create a positive user experience and could be used to draw attention to 
            specific elements like call-to-action buttons or other important messages.</li>
            <li> Black: Black is a classic colour that I will use for text, and borders. It provides a strong contrast against lighter colours, 
            making text and images stand out and improving readability. Black also adds a sense of sophistication and elegance towards the website's 
            overall aesthetic. </li>
            <li> Ivory: Ivory is a creamy off-white colour. It's softer and warmer than pure white, which can feel stark or cold in some contexts. 
            Ivory adds a sense of warmth and elegance to your website, creating a more inviting atmosphere for users. </li>

        </ul>
        
        <h2> Colours: </h2>
        <img src = "../Images/Colours2.jpg" alt = "Colours" width = "500" height = "400">
        <p> The second palette consists of Payne's gray, Columbia blue, Alice Blue, True Blue, and Lapis Lazuli</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Payne's Grey: This colour is a dark, bluish-grey shade. It often conveys a sense of elegance, sophistication, and seriousness. 
            It can be calming and professional, making it suitable for backgrounds or text in areas where I want to evoke trust or authority. 
            Payne's Gray can also provide a strong contrast when paired with lighter colours, enhancing readability and visual hierarchy on the 
            website.</li>
            <li> Columbia Blue: Columbia Blue is a light, pale blue colour reminiscent of clear skies. It evokes feelings of tranquillity, 
            openness, and purity. This colour is often associated with dependability and reliability. Columbia Blue can also create a refreshing 
            and welcoming atmosphere. </li>
            <li> Alice Blue: Alice Blue is a delicate shade of pale blue with a hint of grey. It carries a sense of softness, serenity, and purity. 
            This colour helps create a clean and minimalist aesthetic, making it suitable for backgrounds, borders, or accents. Alice Blue can evoke 
            a sense of calmness and clarity, helping to reduce visual clutter and draw attention to key content or calls to action on the website.</li>
            <li> True Blue: True Blue is a vibrant and saturated blue hue that signifies confidence, stability, and trustworthiness. It's a versatile 
            colour that can be used to create emphasis or focal points on the website. True Blue can evoke a sense of professionalism and authority, 
            making it suitable for headlines, buttons, or important information. Its boldness can also grab users' attention and encourage interaction.</li>
            <li> Lapis Lazuli: Lapis Lazuli is a deep, rich blue colour often associated with luxury, royalty, and spirituality. Its intense hue can evoke 
            feelings of depth, wisdom, and introspection. Lapis Lazuli is well-suited for adding a touch of opulence or sophistication to your website, 
            whether through accents, borders, or decorative elements.</li>
        </ul>
