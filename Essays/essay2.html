            <h1>Digital Colonialism </h1>

            <p> In today's interconnected world, digital colonialism has emerged as a new form of
                dominance, extending traditional colonial practices into the technological realm. Using
                the insightful analysis by Sareeta Amrute(2019) as a framework, this essay explores the
                prominent influence of digital colonialism, particularly in the South African software
                development industry and will also reflect on my position within this sector and my role
                in decoloniality.</p>
            
            <p> Amrute defines colonialism as the acquisition of complete or partial dominance over
                another nation, region, or population, which can include indirect control, as well as
                economic exploitation. However this definition overlooks the concept of digital
                colonialism. Clarke (2023) introduces digital colonialism as a modern form of
                colonialism, where data is appropriated and leveraged for the gain of the digital
                colonizers. This highlights colonialism's evolving nature and influence in the digital age,
                where technological advancements reshape power dynamics. Amrute’s “Tech
                Colonialism Today”, further expands on digital colonialism and its impact in the world.
                Amrute mentions that the development of data, new applications, and social media
                appears to be hierarchical, and is evidenced by the prevalence of techno-chauvinism in
                the industry. Techno-chauvinism is defined by Broussard (2018) as the concept that
                technology is consistently viewed as the top and most effective solution, surpassing
                solution based on human input. Broussard developed the term to describe a select group
                of people, primarily in Silicon Valley, who believe they are superior in developing
                algorithmic applications to govern human lives. However, Hassanli et al. (2022) offer a
                contrasting perspective, arguing that there exists a belief that algorithm creators may not
                fully consider social issues and ethical implications in their work. This tech-chauvinism
                ideology is based on the meritocracy concept, which believes that individual effort and
                intelligence are the main indicators of success, despite increasing proof of widespread
                economic and social inequalities.</p>

            <p> To further discuss the concept of digital colonialism, I will explore three key aspects
                highlighted by Amrute Sareeta (2019): hierarchy, extraction, and exploitation.</p>

            <p> Digital colonialism maintains hierarchical structures that favour the colonizers over the
                colonized. Amrute discusses how these structures position colonizers as superior and
                the colonized as inferior. This is evident in the development and implementation of
                technologies that often marginalize or suppress the educational methods, languages,
                and literacies of the colonized regions. Bidwell (2016) highlights this point by noting that
                technologies from colonizing nations prioritize the languages and literacies of the
                colonizers, rendering the cultures and practices of the colonized as insignificant. This 
                emphasis on the colonizers' languages and literacies leads to a neglect and exclusion of
                the colonized cultures, further increasing the hierarchical order.</p>

            <p> The hierarchical nature of digital colonialism facilitates an extractive relationship where
                resources are systematically taken from colonized regions to benefit the colonizers.
                Bidwell (2016) argues that Western technologies are not purely Western; they are deeply
                dependent on the ideas, labour, and raw materials sourced from former colonies. This
                extraction of resources includes the reliance on minerals and labour from these regions,
                highlighting the continued economic dependency and exploitation. The extraction
                process is filled with ethical issues, including environmental degradation, poor labour
                conditions, and conflict over control of mining areas. Workers in these mines face
                significant health risks and often work in dangerous, unregulated environments. This
                exploitation of labour highlights the unethical practices present in the supply chains of
                digital technologies but also underscores the economic inequalities that digital
                colonialism perpetuates.</p>

            <p> Another aspect of digital colonialism is the exploitation of labour which sometimes is
                presented through oppression and violence. Fuchs (2018) draws attention to the
                dependence of digital technologies on minerals such as cassiterite, coltan, and gold,
                often extracted from conflict zones in Congo. Many of these mines are controlled by
                rebels and warlords who enforce labour through violence and enslavement. The minerals
                sourced from these regions are important to the production of devices like mobile
                phones and laptops. This exploitation is a clear violation of human rights, demonstrating
                how digital colonialism perpetuates forced and child labour, and the broader system of
                labour exploitation under the threat of violence.</p>

            <p> In essence, Digital colonialism replicates previous hierarchies and methods of
                exploitation, marginalising colonised peoples' cultures, resources, and labour while
                assisting the colonisers. Digital colonialism reinforces the power dynamics of traditional
                colonialism in the digital era by maintaining hierarchical structures, encouraging
                extractive relationships and exploiting labour.</p>

            <p> Relating digital colonialism to Google’s decision in the article: Google lays off hundreds
                of ‘Core’ employees, moves some positions to India and Mexico. A form of digital
                colonialism that is present is the labour exploitation and wage disparities. The shift of
                roles to India and Mexico represents a form of a labour exploitation where companies
                capitalize on the lower wage expectations in developing countries. Even though this
                creates job opportunities in these areas, the wage disparity highlights a continuation of
                economic imbalances that favour the profit margins of the corporations headquartered
                in developed nations. Pankaj Rohatgi, Google’s security engineering vice president
                stated that “In order to optimize for our business goals, we are expanding work to other locations, 
                which will result in some role eliminations and proposed role eliminations.”
                This statement highlights Google’s profit-driven exploitation whereas they have
                neglected the local workforce by prioritizing cost savings and business goals over the
                welfare and job security of existing employees. Kwet (2021) highlights this by arguing that
                companies develop their technology with the aim of maximizing profits and exploiting
                resources. It reflects a colonial mindset where the needs and rights of the local
                workforce in developed nations are secondary to the company's financial optimization.
                Another issue with Google’s decision is that the focus on business optimization at the
                expense of the existing workforce highlights a marginalization of employees who are
                treated as disposable resources rather than valued contributors. This marginalization
                can lead to significant personal and community hardships for those affected by the
                layoffs because they are left unemployed which will ultimately affect their financial lives
                if a job is not found. A similar instance where this has occurred is highlighted by Truman
                (2023). According to Truman in February 2023, Twitter has let go of 10% of its remaining
                workforce, equating to approximately 200 employees. This large amount impacted
                various tech staa, including former startup founders whose companies had been
                acquired by Twitter. Since Elon Musk’s ownership of Twitter, the company’s workforce has
                decreased significantly, from around 7,500 employees to less than 2,000. Both
                companies prioritize economic eaiciency and profitability over the well-being of their
                employees, reflecting a colonial mindset that exploits labour and heightens economic
                disparities. This profit-driven approach leads to job insecurity and marginalization of
                workers, who are seen as disposable. These actions highlight the urgent need for
                improved labour practices in the global tech world.</p>

            <p> South Africa is one of the many countries that are also aaected by digital colonialism.
                Kwet (2022) states that South Africa remains largely influenced by U.S. dominance even
                though President Cyril Ramaphosa supports the adoption of 5G technology from China,
                the primary technologies such as search engines (Google), smartphone systems (IOS
                and Android) and social oaice software (Microsoft Oaice and Google Workspace), are
                still chiefly controlled by the United States and other Northern countries. This
                dependence on foreign technology highlights the broader issue of digital colonialism,
                where the technological advancements and digital economies of developing countries
                are shaped and restricted by external powers. The control over these technologies means
                that local digital ecosystems are heavily reliant on the polities, pricing and strategic
                decisions made by these large tech companies. This also impacts the cultural landscape
                of developing nations because content and information available on these platforms are
                often tailored to the preferences of these large tech companies, which can marginalize
                local languages, traditions and perspectives. Kwet (2022) further expands on this issue
                of digital colonialism by stating that Google, Apple, and other U.S. corporations have
                maintained dominance over software, allowing them access to user data and enabling them 
                to influence user experiences in their companies. In 2017, Anton Harber wrote in
                the Financial Mail that Google and Facebook are considered major challengers to the
                South African press. Harber detailed that Google possess 70% of the local online market,
                while social media platforms like Facebook take up an additional 12%. This only leaves
                8% of the market for South Africa’s major media groups (Harber, 2017). This situation can
                be seen as a form of economic dominance where the local industries and companies are
                overshadowed by the expansive power of multinational corporations. This dominance
                not only eliminates local competition but also limits the development of domestic
                industries by taking a significant portion of revenue that could be invested in local media
                and technological areas and as developers in South Africa, the influence of digital
                colonialism profoundly impacts our work and professional landscape. We find ourselves
                heavily reliant on foreign technologies, predominantly controlled by U.S. tech giants,
                which limits our innovation. The tailored content and user experiences of these
                platforms hinder our ability to develop solutions that authentically serve our
                communities and help advance the growth of our local technologies to even greater
                heights. </p>

            <p> As an aspiring African male web developer in South Africa, I am aware of the pervasive
                influence of digital colonialism and the challenges multinational tech companies create
                to the local tech world. My role in decoloniality in the tech sector is not only to build and
                improve my skills but to also contribute to improving the conditions of the colonized tech
                industry. I see myself helping through creating, supporting and promoting locally
                developed technologies that reflect and serve our community’s unique needs, values
                and culture. Decoloniality for me, means actively participating in and supporting a digital
                environment that resits economic domination by external tech giants. Drawing from
                Amrute’s article of what to do in spaces of digital colonialism, I would commit myself to
                joining movements that have already begun to confront the colonial legacies embedded
                in our contemporary social and technological structures. Movements such as the Mozilla
                Foundation that understand the significant influence of the internet in shaping
                economies, governments, and the lives of billions. The Mozilla Foundation is dedicated
                to keeping the internet a positive force, working internationally to support innovative
                ideas, global leaders, and campaigns focused on the public good. Another way I would
                approach decoloniality is through refusal. Refusal by consciously deciding not to engage
                with systems and narratives that perpetuate harm, or injustice. Refusal is powerful
                because it goes beyond non-participation. It is an active rejection of practices and
                structures that continue colonial and oppressive structures. In essence, refusal is a way
                that empowers individuals and communities to dismantle and rebuild systems in a way
                that promotes justice and equity. Another strategy I would also apply draws inspiration
                from Mhlambi (2020) who argues that the way we govern artificial intelligence (AI) should
                include the concept of 'Ubuntu'. Ubuntu is an African idea that emphasizes the
                importance of community and relationships. By including Ubuntu, Mhlambi believes we can 
                challenge the focus on profit and the limited cognitive viewpoints that currently
                dominate AI and data practices influenced by colonialism. He asserts that incorporating
                the community-centred values of Ubuntu can create a more ethical and inclusive
                approach to AI. This approach demonstrates that the inclusiveness of South African
                culture can help mitigate the effects of digital colonialism. It inspires me to integrate
                more Africanized methods into my design and code, creating systems centred around
                African values. This not only empowers and promotes our culture in the tech world but
                also includes marginalized people who are often overlooked by multinational tech
                companies. </p>

            <p> In conclusion, digital colonialism extends traditional forms of domination into the
                technological realm, perpetuating hierarchical structures, exploitation, and economic
                imbalances that disadvantage developing countries. The software development sector
                in South Africa serves as an example of how global tech corporations use undue
                influence, influencing local digital ecosystems and marginalizing local traditions and
                views. As an aspiring African male web developer in South Africa, I recognize my
                responsibility in challenging these dynamics. By producing and promoting locally
                developed technologies, engaging in movements to confront colonial legacies, and
                integrating African principles into my work, I aim to contribute to a more equitable and
                inclusive digital future. Ultimately, decoloniality in the tech sector requires a collective
                effort to resist economic domination and affirm the unique needs and values of our
                communities.</p>
