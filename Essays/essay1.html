            <h2>UX & UI Analysis</h2>

            <p> Websites play a crucial role in the world today and are used as platforms that
                significantly influence the ways people find, interact, and consume media. This
                essay will analyse a South African website, focusing on its user interface, user
                experience and ethics relating to interaction design. </p>

            <p> User Interface (UI) and user experience (UX) are important when dealing with
                websites, as they allow users to engage and interact with the system. UX refers to
                the overall experience users feel when navigating through a website, these include
                components like user-friendliness, efficiency, and satisfaction. “User Experience (UX)
                is the communication through interfaces, interaction, and experience that users
                have with an organization’s products and services.” (Sharma and Tiwari, 2021). On
                the other hand, UI focuses on the visual and interactive components of the website,
                these include buttons, menus, and layouts, which help improve the user interaction
                and enhance the overall usability, “UI would focus on the visual design of the
                screens a user interacts with” (Sharma and Tiwari, 2021). Both UX and UI ensure that
                users have a smooth, intuitive experience navigating around the website’s content.</p>

            <p> The website that will be used in this essay is the <a href = "https://www.builders.co.za">Builders Warehouse</a>. 
                Builders warehouse is a hardware store that specializes
                in outdoor furniture, tools, building materials and other products related to
                construction. The website consists of pros and cons which affect the overall
                experience and engagement of users.</p>

            <p> Some of the pros of the Builders website include presenting users with multiple
                products and options to choose from, offering clear and concise information about
                each product categorized by brand, product type, and product use, allowing users
                to easily check the availability of desired products at different branches, and
                efficiently categorizing products, such as outdoor garden and patio/lighting and
                reducing the time spent searching for products. The con evident in the Builders
                website was that rather than using a single interface container enabling users to
                select different versions of the same product, multiple buttons representing
                identical products was displayed instead.</p>

            <p> “If the interface is poorly designed, the user’s ability to tap the computational
                power of an application may be severely hindered.” (Sridevi, 2014). Users may find
                it difficult to fully utilise and explore the features of the website if the interface is
                badly designed. There are user interface elements that aid the functionality of a
                website and other efficient ways to interact with the website, these include: input
                controls, navigational components, and informational components.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <ul> 
                <li> Input Controls are the elements of a user interface that allow users to
                    interact with the system by providing input. They give users the ability to
                    input data and make selections within website. These include text fields,
                    buttons, checkboxes, dropdown lists, toggles, etc. The Builders website has
                    text fields that are visible in the sign-in area where users can log into their
                    individual accounts by inputting their personal information. It also has drop-
                    down lists that let users choose several products from various departments,
                    like windows and doors.</li>

                <li>Navigational Components are elements of a user interface that help users
                    navigate through different sections or pages of a website. They help users
                    move from one part of the interface to another. These include tags,
                    navigation bars, breadcrumbs, tabs, sliders, etc. The Builders website has
                    navigation bars that allow users to move between pages for example moving
                    from the catalogues page to the ‘Contact Us’ page.</li>

                <li>Informational Components are elements of a user interface that display
                    information to the users. They present relevant information, feedback, or
                    instructions to users about the system and its content. These include icons,
                    tooltips, progress bars, error messages, notifications, etc. The Builders
                    website displays error messages when the user enters the incorrect
                    email/password when signing in, “Please enter valid password”.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p> S. Sridevi outlines three important principles that guide the design of effective user
                interfaces:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li> Place the user in control: "What I really would like," said the user solemnly,
                    "is a system that reads my mind. It knows what I want to do before I need to
                    do it and makes it very easy for me to get it done. That’s all, just that."
                    (Sridevi.S, 2014). The Builders website presents the user with multiple
                    interaction points that are efficient in ordering, purchasing, selecting,
                    searching, and contacting. By providing these options, the website allows
                    users to choose the actions they wish to pursue, enabling them to be in
                    control of their experience. For example, a user may create a profile on the
                    Builders website today and utilize other features on another occasion
                    depending on their current needs and preferences.</li>

                <li> Reduce the user’s memory load: The user is more likely to make errors if
                    they have to remember a lot of information. The system should remember
                    information and assist the user when interacting so they may recall necessary
                    information. The Builders website reduces the user’s memory load by storing
                    the information of the user’s selected products to the cart and the choices
                    made for their colours and size.></li>

                <li> Make the interface consistent: Refers to a website presenting content in a
                    consistent fashion; all the visual information is organized in a consistent
                    layout, mechanisms for navigating from task to task are consistently defined
                    and implemented. On the Builders website, the layout of the products is
                    presented in a consistent, unified, and familiar fashion. Each product has: an
                    image, name, price, product description, and add-to-cart button.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section> 
            <p> These principles serve as fundamental guidelines for designing user interfaces that
                prioritize the user’s needs and facilitate positive user experiences.</p>

            <p> Just like UI, UX has benefits and these include user-centred design, increased trust,
                and reduction of long-term costs.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li> User centred, value-based design focuses on the user’s needs and
                    preferences, ensuring that the design is centred around providing value to
                    them, this can lead to positive user experiences. In the Builders website, the
                    content and UI is centred around the user and their construction supply needs.</li>

                <li> Increased trust may cause users to visit the website more because of their
                    positive experience on the website, and for businesses this may result in
                    increased profits and sales/clicks. With my experience on the Builders website,
                    I found it to be user-friendly and easy to use, all the products were easy to find,
                    and the signified meaning of the interface elements were easy to understand,
                    for example the heart icon representing a user’s Wishlist.</li>
                
                <li> Reduction of long-term costs, if the website is set up correctly, there would be
                    fewer usability issues and user complaints, which will save costs associated with
                    fixing problems</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section> 
            <p> Various factors significantly influence user experience. To understand the
                importance and impact of UX, here is an insightful perspective offered by
                Sonderegger, Uebelbacher, and Sauer (2019): “UX is the totality of actions,
                sensations, thinking, feelings and meaning making of a person in a specific
                situational context. These factors according to Goldberg, P (2024) include Call to
                action (CTA) and visual representations such as balance and alignment, shapes
                implying meaning, etc. Now let’s apply these to the Builders website.</p>
            
            <ul>

                <li> Call to action (CTA) is based on the purpose of the content, it can inspire a
                    wide range of actions. Examples would be: “Sign up”, “Subscribe” or “Join
                    us”. On the Builders website, the CTA is found on the home page, and it’s
                    related to a promotional offer of paint supplies and urges the user to interact
                    with it through the “Shop Now” button.</li>

                <li> Balance and alignment are the definition of aligning visual components in a
                    composition to create a composition that is clear, confident, formal, and
                    reliable. On the Builders website the visual components of products are
                    aligned in rows, which almost gives the effect of shelved products that are
                    common in the physical Builders stores. The compositions are clear and
                    concise and are aligned neatly, making it easier to locate products and skim
                    through them.</li>
                
                <li> Shapes implying meaning, some shapes signify certain emotions, and help
                    communicate characteristics of the website. For example: square/ rectangle
                    shapes represent seriousness and discipline, and rounded corners represent
                    confidence. On the Builders website the shapes used on the interface are
                    circles and, rounded corners and these represent friendliness and charisma.</li>
            
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>

        <p> Toni Robertson emphasizes that interaction design is about creating user
            experiences that enhance and extend the way people work, communicate, and
            interact, as stated in Preece et al’s work from 2002. When developers are
            programming websites, they have to be aware of the ethical implications that are
            involved in interaction design, which will ultimately affect the user and their
            experience. Here are some unethical factors related to interaction design:</p>
        
        <ul>

            <li> Lack of accessibility refers to often neglecting the needs of users, users with
                disabilities. This may result in inaccessibility for certain individuals, which can
                be seen as inequality and exclusion. “Research has shown that people with
                disabilities are most at risk of being excluded from access, particularly people
                who are blind or visually impaired and who use assistive technologies such as
                screen readers.” (Brophy and Craven, 2007). On the Builders website I
                haven’t identified any settings options that may cater to individuals with
                disabilities.</li>

            <li> Manipulative designs/persuasive techniques: designers sometimes use
                manipulative ways to influence a user’s behaviour in ways that are beneficial
                to stakeholders and not to users. For example, online stores may display ‘2
                left’ when there are more products in stock, leading users to make impulsive
                decisions. This is an unethical behaviour because it is dishonest.</li>

            <li>Privacy violations: Websites may sometimes involve the collection and
                processing of user data, sometimes without consent and ultimately violate
                user privacy rights. The user data can then be sold to other businesses to
                produce targeted advertising. "A major funding mechanism for the web is
                behavioural advertising—that is, advertising which is targeted based on a
                user’s personal information, interests, and past behaviours" (Englehardt,
                2018).</li>

        </ul>

        <p> I haven’t identified any of these unethical factors on the Builders website.</p>

        <p> The Builders Warehouse website is analyzed in this essay, with focus on the
            website's user interface (UI), user experience (UX), and ethical implications for
            interaction design. It looks at the Builders website’s advantages in terms of easy-to-
            use navigation and clear product presentation, but it also points out areas that
            could be better. The essay addresses the significance of user control, memory load
            reduction, and interface consistency by drawing on the fundamentals of successful
            UI design. It also discusses elements that affect user experience (UX), like call-to-
            action tactics and visual harmony and emphasises the advantages of user-centred
            design. The essay ends with stating factors that are unethical in terms of interaction
            design. </p>
