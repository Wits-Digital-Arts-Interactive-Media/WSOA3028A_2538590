    <h2>Week 4: Blogpost</h2>

<h3>Goal Alignment: </h3>

<p>So the goal is to pass the module.  Okay, let me be serious, my goal is to present a functional and user-friendly website that 
showcases my art and work completed throughout the semester. I do want the website to show my personality in some way, and let the 
user know who the website is about.</p>

<h3>Information Structure:</h3>

<h3>User Flow:</h3>

<h3>Interface Elements: </h3>

<p>In my week 3 blogpost, I’ve mentioned which types of interface elements I would use, here is a recap:</p>

<p>Input Controls: buttons that will each contain minimal information about a specific artwork until users click and they will be presented
with more information.</p>

<p>Navigational Components: breadcrumb, which would help users move between different pages effectively.</p>

<p>Informational Components: message boxes, in this case I want to use the message boxes in a funny way by giving random facts about 
myself and this will kinda show my personality. For example: “I like cars, and if the economy allowed, I would want to have eight of 
them”. </p>

<p>I’ve learnt that shapes play a huge part in the tone of your website and how each shape signifies a certain emotion. I don’t want my
website to be too serious but I also don’t want it to be too friendly so I am going to have rectangular buttons with smooth/circular 
edges which will indicate a more neutral tone.</p>

<h3>Design- Style guide & Wireframes:</h3>

<p>My wireframes haven’t changed, I have considered the minor changes such as the shapes of the interface. The aesthetic will remain the
same, offering a minimalistic look with modern fonts, and neutral colours such as grey.</p>

<h3>Reflect on how your original wireframes hold up in line with this process:</h3>

<p>My wireframes include a lot of elements that I think will only be possible to execute after learning CSS and JavaScript.</p>

<h3>Reflect on your work for Website: Where have you struggled?</h3>

<p>The thing I struggled with at first was the understanding the basics of HTML, I really had to dive into the theory before I began the 
practical work. There was a lot of things to consider and a huge question that pops up before making an decision is ‘why?’ and I had to 
really think about that with everything I worked on. The MDN developer page helped so much in understanding elements, tags and other 
basic HTML tips, so it wasn’t much of a struggle because all the necessary resources were given to us.</p>

<h3>What are you proud of?</h3>

<p>I’m proud of is how serious I take Interactive Media, for once I am doing something  I enjoy and that I’m also eager to learn more 
about it. It’s much easier than C# and I can’t wait to learn more about web design. I also find it easier to code HTML without watching 
a step-by-step tutorial, so it makes me happy that I understand the basics to it.</p>

<h3>What do you want to change going forward?</h3>

<p>I would want to change my approach and process to the website, I think I don’t make sufficient planning towards the development of my
website. I would want to make more mind-maps and ask myself more questions to improve my process.</p>
