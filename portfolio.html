    <p1>As I've stated, I have had my fair share of experience with different types of design and I will use this page to showcase 
        the work I've done. These are some of my favourites and I hope you'll love them as much as I do.

    <h2>Graphic Design</h2>

    <p2>These are some of the graphic design works I made.As you can see these include product design and poster design. I managed 
        to make these with 1 year of experience with Adobe Photoshop. I really hope to continue to grow and improve my skills. </p2>

   <h3>Interior Design</h3>

   <p3>These are my Interior and Architectural designs. I have a thing for buildings and their functionality and what can be done
    to any empty room to make it more aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly for the people who occupy the space.
