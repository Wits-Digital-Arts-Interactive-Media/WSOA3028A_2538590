    <h1>Week 1: Blogpost</h1>

    <p1> My experience setting up GitHub and publishing to Pages:

        Setting up GitHub wasnt much of a challenge, we had a basic understanding of the application, and its functions but it was confusing when it was time to link GitHub to Visual Studio Code. 
        I experienced problems when I was unaware that Visual Studio doesn’t automatically save the changes you make to the script such as ‘comments’ which then made it hard to publish the page through GitHub. 
        I do believe that through practice it will get easier to implement.
        
         
        Reflection on the readings I selected, relating it to my experience with internet today:
        
        The readings I engaged with were: What Hypertext is by Noah Wardrip-Fruin and As we may think by Vannevar Bush.
        
         
        
        Regarding What Hypertext is, I grasped a basic understanding of what hypertext is using a definition by Marie Laure Ryan,
        “In hypertext… the reader determines the unfolding of the text by clicking on certain areas, the so-called hyperlinks, that bring to the screen other segments of text.” This definition got me to 
        understand how interactivity deals with links, how one component is connected to another component, for example how the link to a published scholarly essay will direct you to a website that contains
        the PDF version of the essay where users can view and read the text. The reading also got me to learn about hypermedia which are branches and presentations which respond to user actions and how they
        are systems of prearranged words and pictures, which can be freely explored.  
        
         
        
        The thing that caught my attention in As we may think, was how the text focused on the anticipation and vision of the technological devices we have today. It made me understand the limitations that
        people had before these advancements, for example how people had to store information in books, in organized and systematic ways that were time consuming and inefficient compared to the rapid technology 
        we share today that allows users to efficiently locate information from vast sets of data. Instead of going to the library, we can access a digital library through a website such as Google Scholar, to be 
        able to read the same information that is present in physical books. The reading also allowed me to understand the concept of Memex, although I don’t have a solid understanding of the concept, I understand 
        how it is essentially a private file or library for individual use, it allows users to store various materials such as records and personal notes and offers them easy access to it. I think of Memex as a house 
        for the user, where they can place their information in different rooms of the house and arrange them in any way they want.
        
        
        Interesting things I found about the history of the web:
        
        The thing I found interesting was how outdated devices such as dry photography and microphotography were once the most reliable and efficient devices to capture and store information. I was fascinated by 
        how the passage As we may think, envisioned most of the devices we have today, for example a system where researchers can talk directly to a machine that types their spoken words, this just made me think 
        of Siri and how this virtual assistant, collects the information of the user and presents it in a convenient way to the user, for example: “Hey Siri, what does interactivity mean?: and Siri will respond by
        reading the most common and popular definition on the internet. This made me appreciate the technology we have, because it was a vision for someone and a reality for us.
        
         
        
        My goals for this course:
        
        I have had a bit of experience with websites but only through the use of the web design software called Wix, making websites using that software made me consider so many components of a website that
        I did not really find significant, for example interface buttons that help you navigate from one page of the website to another. This exposure made me want to learn more about web design and what goes 
        into it to make it successful. My goals for the course are to learn how to create websites from scratch and to gain fundamental knowledge and skills required to understand web design and how to make easy 
        and efficient to the user.

        Week 2: Blog Post

Discuss your folder structure and URL scheme. Outline your decision-making:

At first I had no clue what was meant by the word ‘scheme’ and had no idea what was required from us. I asked a few of my classmates to help and I had a basic understanding of what was required. It’s basically 
how your website will be stacked in a cupboard and whenever the user needs certain information, the respective folder is pulled from the cupboard.

Here are my folders

-index.html = the homepage that will give a little information about the website and about myself
-portfolio.html = the portfolio page will display the work I’ve previously done which I would want to showcase.
-contact.html = the contact page will offer the user my contact details such as my social media accounts, emails and phone numbers.
-blog.html = the blog page will showcase the weekly posts that I’ve done, including additional commentary.
-essays.html = the essays page will showcase essays that will be done throughout the semester.
-Images folder: will contain all the images that will be used in the website, for example images of the portfolio.

How the URL will potentially look like:

https://matalame.comLinks to an external site.

https://matalame.com/homeLinks to an external site.

https://matalame.com/portfolio/graphicdesignLinks to an external site.

https://matalame.com/portfolio/interiordesignLinks to an external site.

https://matalame.com/blogs/week1Links to an external site.

https://matalame.com/contactLinks to an external site.

https://matalame.com/about/meLinks to an external site.

I think this will help the user know where they are on my website and I learnt from lecture 2 that as the designers we should aim at making the URL’s 
human readable so it can be simpler to understand and that keeping the URL short makes it easier to share, reduces mental overload, is reliable. Lastly, 
that we should avoid long strings of numbers or characters, I think this makes the URL harder to understand and more clustered.

Put in images of your first wireframe ideas and explain what you are thinking of doing:

For my wireframes I decided to create a detailed visual representation of how I would want my website to look like.

Wireframe 1:
<img src = "Images/Wireframe1.jpg" width="600" height = "400">
I would want to structure my home page like this, with user interface buttons that help the user navigate through the website just from clicking. 
I want to an include an image of myself but I’m also considering putting a silhouette of myself, like the image portrays. I would also want to include 
a quote about Interactivity just as an icebreaker.

Wireframe 2:
<img src = "Images/Wireframe2.jpg" width="600" height = "400">
This is part of the home page. It includes a little overview about myself, my interests, my goals and just some random stuff.

Wireframe 3:
<img src = "Images/Wireframe3.jpg" width="600" height = "400">
This is the page that takes the user to the different categories of my portfolio and these will be user interface buttons that will take the user 
to the respective pages with the images and information of my portfolio.

Wireframe 4:
<img src = "Images/Wireframe4.jpg" width="600" height = "400">
This is how the portfolio page will look like, it includes images of the work and descriptions of the work.

Wireframe 5: 
<img src = "Images/Wireframe5.jpg" width="600" height = "400">
This is how the blog page will look and there will be user interface buttons that will allow the user to choose which blog they want to read .

Wireframe 6:
<img src = "Images/Wireframe6.jpg" width="600" height = "400">
The essay page is similar to the blogs page.

Wireframe 7: 
<img src = "Images/Wireframe7.jpg" width="600" height = "400">
This is the contact page that will include all my necessary details.

Put in links to websites that are inspirational, and start collecting reference material here:

 

https://ready.so/Links to an external site. : I really like the way the text of this website is laid out, as well as the images. I drew inspiration from this to make my wireframe for the ’ About Me’ section.
https://www.aprilford.comLinks to an external site. : I used inspiration from this website to position the user interface for the different pages of the website at the top left of the website.
https://webflow.com/made-in-webflow/website/hsu-mccullough-wipLinks to an external site. : The way the images in this website are positioned, inspired the way I will position my images for the portfolio page.
 

Reflect on Moulthrop, S. (2003) ‘You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media (1991)’: how does it speak to the internet today? 

Moulthrop seemed to be concerned about the rapid growth of hypertext and how overwhelming it may be. He also reflects om the cyclical nature of technological trends and how hypertext could be temporarily popular. 
This made me think how technology is rapidly growing and how one technological advancement could be so popular but be replaced by other technological advancement, it makes me question whether they’ll ever be a 
technological advancement that cannot be surpassed in or if this will be a never ending cycle of constant technological improvements and ideas.

The reading also taught me how Hypertext systems utilize the interactive potential of computers to create variable- access databases, allowing any unit of discourse to have multiple associations.

 
Reflect on interaction and the www: what does interaction mean to you?

Let me start of by mentioning my favourite part about the lecture: “we are in the business of manipulation”. I never thought of how as web designers, we manipulate the user to make certain actions such as clicking 
on a link on our websites, it made me think of the psychological part of it, and how we should understand our user to ultimately manipulate them.

Interaction to me is how input leads to output. In order for something to be interactable there has to be an outcome as a result of an input. In web design, I think the interaction can be seen when the user clicks
on a user interface element (home button) and it directs the user to the respective page (home page). 

The lecture taught me more about interactivity and how it should be responsive and not respond in a completely random fashion. I don’t think I’ve ever thought of how websites are not random, how when you click on 
the close button, it closes the tab and not shut down the computer.  

I also feel like a huge part of interactivity is ‘feedback’, because feedback allows the user to know that something has happened from something they did, an example of this would be how the light switches on once 
the laptop charger is switched on.
