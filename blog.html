    <h2>Week 1: Blogpost</h2>

    <h4> My experience setting up GitHub and publishing to Pages:</h4>

        <p> Setting up GitHub wasnt much of a challenge, we had a basic understanding of the application, and its functions 
        but it was confusing when it was time to link GitHub to Visual Studio Code. 
        I experienced problems when I was unaware that Visual Studio doesn’t automatically save the changes you make to the 
        script such as ‘comments’ which then made it hard to publish the page through GitHub. 
        I do believe that through practice it will get easier to implement. </p>
        
         
    <h4>Reflection on the readings I selected, relating it to my experience with internet today: </h4>
        
        <p>The readings I engaged with were: What Hypertext is by Noah Wardrip-Fruin and As we may think by Vannevar Bush.
        Regarding What Hypertext is, I grasped a basic understanding of what hypertext is using a definition by Marie Laure Ryan,
        “In hypertext… the reader determines the unfolding of the text by clicking on certain areas, the so-called hyperlinks, 
        that bring to the screen other segments of text.” This definition got me to understand how interactivity deals with links, 
        how one component is connected to another component, for example how the link to a published scholarly essay will direct 
        you to a website that contains the PDF version of the essay where users can view and read the text. The reading also got 
        me to learn about hypermedia which are branches and presentations which respond to user actions and how they are systems 
        of prearranged words and pictures, which can be freely explored.</p>
        
        <p>The thing that caught my attention in As we may think, was how the text focused on the anticipation and vision of the 
        technological devices we have today. It made me understand the limitations thatpeople had before these advancements, for 
        example how people had to store information in books, in organized and systematic ways that were time consuming and inefficient 
        compared to the rapid technology we share today that allows users to efficiently locate information from vast sets of data.
        Instead of going to the library, we can access a digital library through a website such as Google Scholar, to be able to read
        the same information that is present in physical books. The reading also allowed me to understand the concept of Memex, although 
        I don’t have a solid understanding of the concept, I understand how it is essentially a private file or library for individual 
        use, it allows users to store various materials such as records and personal notes and offers them easy access to it. I think 
        of Memex as a house for the user, where they can place their information in different rooms of the house and arrange them in 
        any way they want.</p>
        
        
    <h4>Interesting things I found about the history of the web:</h4>
        
        <p>The thing I found interesting was how outdated devices such as dry photography and microphotography were once the most reliable 
        and efficient devices to capture and store information. I was fascinated by how the passage As we may think, envisioned most of 
        the devices we have today, for example a system where researchers can talk directly to a machine that types their spoken words, 
        this just made me think of Siri and how this virtual assistant, collects the information of the user and presents it in a convenient 
        way to the user, for example: “Hey Siri, what does interactivity mean?: and Siri will respond by reading the most common and popular
        definition on the internet. This made me appreciate the technology we have, because it was a vision for someone and a reality for us.</p>
         
         
        
    <h4> My goals for this course:</h4>
        
        <p>I have had a bit of experience with websites but only through the use of the web design software called Wix, making websites using 
        that software made me consider so many components of a website that I did not really find significant, for example interface buttons 
        that help you navigate from one page of the website to another. This exposure made me want to learn more about web design and what goes 
        into it to make it successful. My goals for the course are to learn how to create websites from scratch and to gain fundamental knowledge 
        and skills required to understand web design and how to make easy and efficient to the user. </p>

    <h2>Week 2: Blog Post</h2>
    
    <h4> Discuss your folder structure and URL scheme. Outline your decision-making:</h4>

    <p> At first I had no clue what was meant by the word ‘scheme’ and had no idea what was required from us. I asked a few of my classmates 
        to help and I had a basic understanding of what was required. It’s basically how your website will be stacked in a cupboard and whenever 
        the user needs certain information, the respective folder is pulled from the cupboard.</p>
       
    <p> Here are my folders:</p>

    <p> -index.html = the homepage that will give a little information about the website and about myself
    -portfolio.html = the portfolio page will display the work I’ve previously done which I would want to showcase.
    -contact.html = the contact page will offer the user my contact details such as my social media accounts, emails and phone numbers.
    -blog.html = the blog page will showcase the weekly posts that I’ve done, including additional commentary.
    -essays.html = the essays page will showcase essays that will be done throughout the semester.
    -Images folder: will contain all the images that will be used in the website, for example images of the portfolio. </p>

    <p>How the URL will potentially look like:</p>

    <li> https://matalame.com </li>
    <li> https://matalame.com/home </li>
    <li> https://matalame.com/portfolio/graphicdesign </li>
    <li> https://matalame.com/portfolio/interiordesign </li>
    <li> https://matalame.com/blogs/week1 </li>
    <li> https://matalame.com/contact </li>
    <li> https://matalame.com/about/me </li>


<p>I think this will help the user know where they are on my website and I learnt from lecture 2 that as the designers we 
    should aim at making the URL’s human readable so it can be simpler to understand and that keeping the URL short makes it easier 
    to share, reduces mental overload, is reliable. Lastly, that we should avoid long strings of numbers or characters, 
    I think this makes the URL harder to understand and more clustered. </p>

<h4>Put in images of your first wireframe ideas and explain what you are thinking of doing: </h4>

<p>For my wireframes I decided to create a detailed visual representation of how I would want my website to look like. </p>

<h4>Wireframe 1: </h4>
<img src = "Images/Wireframe1.jpg" width="600" height = "400">
<p>I would want to structure my home page like this, with user interface buttons that help the user navigate through the website just 
from clicking. I want to an include an image of myself but I’m also considering putting a silhouette of myself, like the image portrays. 
I would also want to include a quote about Interactivity just as an icebreaker.</p>

<h4>Wireframe 2: </h4>
<img src = "Images/Wireframe2.jpg" width="600" height = "400">
<p>This is part of the home page. It includes a little overview about myself, my interests, my goals and just some random stuff.</p>

<h4>Wireframe 3: </h4>
<img src = "Images/Wireframe3.jpg" width="600" height = "400">
<p>This is the page that takes the user to the different categories of my portfolio and these will be user interface buttons that will 
take the user to the respective pages with the images and information of my portfolio.</p>

<h4>Wireframe 4:</h4>
<img src = "Images/Wireframe4.jpg" width="600" height = "400">
<p>This is how the portfolio page will look like, it includes images of the work and descriptions of the work.</p>

<h4>Wireframe 5: </h4> 
<img src = "Images/Wireframe5.jpg" width="600" height = "400">
<p>This is how the blog page will look and there will be user interface buttons that will allow the user to choose which blog they 
want to read.</p>

<h4>Wireframe 6: </h4>
<img src = "Images/Wireframe6.jpg" width="600" height = "400">
<p>The essay page is similar to the blogs page.</p>

<h4>Wireframe 7: </h4> 
<img src = "Images/Wireframe7.jpg" width="600" height = "400">
<p>This is the contact page that will include all my necessary details.</p>

<h4>Put in links to websites that are inspirational, and start collecting reference material here:</h4>

<li> <a href = "https://ready.so">Ready.so Website</a> 
<p>I really like the way the text of this website is laid out, as well as the images. 
I drew inspiration from this to make my wireframe for the ’ About Me’ section. </p> 
<img src = "Images/ReadySo.png" alt="Screenshot of Ready.so website" width = "700" height = "400"> </li>

<li> <a href ="https://www.aprilford.com">April Ford Website</a> 
<p>I used inspiration from this website to position the user interface for the different pages of the 
website at the top left of the website. </p>
<img src = "Images/AprilFord.png" alt = "Screenshot of AprilFord website" width = "700" height = "400"> </li>

<li> <a href = "https://webflow.com" > Web Flow Website</a>
<p>The way the images in this website are positioned, inspired the way I will position my images for the portfolio page. 
<img src = "Images/Webflow.png" alt = "Screenshot of WebFlow website" width = "700" height = "400"> </p>
 

<h4>Reflect on Moulthrop, S. (2003) ‘You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media (1991)’: how does it speak to 
    the internet today?</h4>

<p>Moulthrop seemed to be concerned about the rapid growth of hypertext and how overwhelming it may be. He also reflects om the 
cyclical nature of technological trends and how hypertext could be temporarily popular. This made me think how technology is rapidly 
growing and how one technological advancement could be so popular but be replaced by other technological advancement, it makes me 
question whether they’ll ever be a technological advancement that cannot be surpassed in or if this will be a never ending cycle of 
constant technological improvements and ideas.</p>  

<p>The reading also taught me how Hypertext systems utilize the interactive potential of computers to create variable- access databases, 
allowing any unit of discourse to have multiple associations.</p>

 
<h4>Reflect on interaction and the www: what does interaction mean to you?</h4>

<p>Let me start of by mentioning my favourite part about the lecture: “we are in the business of manipulation”. I never thought of how 
as web designers, we manipulate the user to make certain actions such as clicking on a link on our websites, it made me think of the 
psychological part of it, and how we should understand our user to ultimately manipulate them. </p>

<p>Interaction to me is how input leads to output. In order for something to be interactable there has to be an outcome as a result of 
an input. In web design, I think the interaction can be seen when the user clickson a user interface element (home button) and 
it directs the user to the respective page (home page). </p>
 
<p>The lecture taught me more about interactivity and how it should be responsive and not respond in a completely random fashion. 
I don’t think I’ve ever thought of how websites are not random, how when you click on the close button, it closes the tab and not shut 
down the computer. </p>

<p>I also feel like a huge part of interactivity is ‘feedback’, because feedback allows the user to know that something has happened 
from something they did, an example of this would be how the light switches on once the laptop charger is switched on.</p>



<h2>Week 3: Blogpost</h2>
<h4>User Alignment:</h4>

<p>User alignment refers to making sure a website is easy to use and clearly shows what it's meant for. It's about ensuring that the 
website's goals match what users want, making everything simple and straightforward. It involves ensuring that the design and 
interface are seamlessly aligned with the user’s expectations, making the overall experience straightforward and user-friendly.  
Essentially, it's like making sure the website and the user are on the same page and understand each other easily. The target audience 
makes it easier to consider what the user would expect from the page, for example if the target audience was fitness and health 
enthusiasts the website would probably have content centred around fitness, health recipes, wellness tips and motivation. It would also 
feature workout videos, tips and meal-planning tools.</p>

<p>What about my website?</p>

<p>My website would be used to showcase and promote my portfolio and my target audience will be potential employers or potential 
collaborators for passion projects. I want my website to be easy to use by including the necessary input controls such as links, 
this ensures that navigating through my portfolio is straightforward, enabling visitors, especially my target audience to easily 
access and explore my showcased work. The intention with regards to the user is to create a seamless and intuitive experience that 
effectively communicates my skills and expertise to users especially those with my shared interests.</p>

<h4>User Experience:</h4>

<p>This refers to what users feel when they interact with the website. I would start off with the information structure and determine 
what content goes with another and where it will be positioned. Then determine the options the user has at each point, if it’s the page 
for my blogs, the user should be able to access any blog post at any time. From the lecture I learnt how user experience considers many 
types of users, for example users with bad connection speeds, will the website offer text to represent the images? Another example would
be users who are colour blind, will the website has a feature that is capable of adjusting colours to be user-friendly for those who 
are colour blind. Another thing I would want my website to have is feedback, to help the user know what results are caused by their 
input, for example interactive elements like buttons changing colour to acknowledge user interactions, providing visual feedback. 
Another example would be load spinners or progress bars, when my website is processing a request or loading images, the spinners will 
represent the action of loading which gives the user feedback about that process.</p>

<h4>Interface Elements: </h4>

<p>User interface elements are necessary when a decision needs to be made and it must be represented in the interface to the system, 
for example a ‘BUY’ button on a online shoe store.</p>

<p>Input Controls: For my website I want to include buttons that will each contain minimal information about a specific artwork until 
they click and are then presented with more information.</p>

<p>Navigational Components: For the navigation I would want to include a breadcrumb, which would help users move between different 
pages effectively. </p> 

<p>Informational Components: this section I would want to include message boxes, in this case I want to use the message boxes in a 
funny way by giving random facts about myself and this will kinda show my personality. For example: “I like cars, and if the economy 
allowed, I would want to have eight of them”. </p>  

<h4>Reflect on how the exercise above relates to what you know about your structure and URL scheme, and how it relates to 
semantic markup.</h4>

<p>These exercises made me think of the amount of planning that goes into the structure of a website. It made me think of how important
the user is and how much of a priority they are. In terms of the URL scheme, it should be easy to read and help the user know at where 
they are on the website.</p>

<p>With regards to how it relates to semantic markup, semantic markup is defined as the use of markup language such as HTML to convey 
information about the meaning of each element in a document through proper selection of markup elements to maintain complete separation 
between the markup and the visual presentation of the elements contained in the document. This definition makes me see the importance 
of using the correct elements to structure your website and these could ultimately affect the user experience if they are used 
incorrectly and they could also affect the way the intended goal of the website is, for example if the wrong elements were used the 
structure of the website could be incomplete or different.</p>

<h4>Reflect on your development progress for the week. </h4>
<p>I went through the lectures Lucky taught and I got to understand the importance of semantic markup, and how each tag has a 
significant use in the code, I won’t lie the tag <div> </div> and <span></span> are still foreign to me and I still don’t fully 
understand them. I do understand that <div></div> renders in blocks while <span></span> renders in a line, for example if you’re adding 
a link in a sentence. The lecture also taught me cool Google Chrome developer tools, It was fun playing around with the Wits website 
and getting to understand HTML through existing websites on the internet. This week I aimed at fixing my code and trying to implement 
the semantic markup, by using the correct tags so the console or ‘bot’ understand what I want my website to look like. I also learnt 
a lot about UI and UX and how they work together to ensure that the website is easy to use for the user.</p>

<h2>Week 4: Blogpost</h2>

<h4>Goal Alignment: </h4>

<p>So the goal is to pass the module.  Okay, let me be serious, my goal is to present a functional and user-friendly website that 
showcases my art and work completed throughout the semester. I do want the website to show my personality in some way, and let the 
user know who the website is about.</p>

<h4>Information Structure:</h4>

<h4>Interface Elements: </h4>

<p>In my week 3 blogpost, I’ve mentioned which types of interface elements I would use, here is a recap:</p>

<p>Input Controls: buttons that will each contain minimal information about a specific artwork until users click and they will be presented
with more information.</p>

<p>Navigational Components: breadcrumb, which would help users move between different pages effectively.</p>

<p>Informational Components: message boxes, in this case I want to use the message boxes in a funny way by giving random facts about 
myself and this will kinda show my personality. For example: “I like cars, and if the economy allowed, I would want to have eight of 
them”. </p>

<p>I’ve learnt that shapes play a huge part in the tone of your website and how each shape signifies a certain emotion. I don’t want my
website to be too serious but I also don’t want it to be too friendly so I am going to have rectangular buttons with smooth/circular 
edges which will indicate a more neutral tone.</p>

<h4>Design- Style guide & Wireframes:</h4>

<p>My wireframes haven’t changed, I have considered the minor changes such as the shapes of the interface. The aesthetic will remain the
same, offering a minimalistic look with modern fonts, and neutral colours such as grey.</p>

<h4>Reflect on how your original wireframes hold up in line with this process:</h4>

<p>My wireframes include a lot of elements that I think will only be possible to execute after learning CSS and JavaScript.</p>

<h4>Reflect on your work for Website:</h4>

<h4>Where have you struggled? </h4>

<p>The thing I struggled with at first was the understanding the basics of HTML, I really had to dive into the theory before I began the 
practical work. There was a lot of things to consider and a huge question that pops up before making an decision is ‘why?’ and I had to 
really think about that with everything I worked on. The MDN developer page helped so much in understanding elements, tags and other 
basic HTML tips, so it wasn’t much of a struggle because all the necessary resources were given to us.</p>

<h4>What are you proud of?</h4>

<p>I’m proud of is how serious I take Interactive Media, for once I am doing something  I enjoy and that I’m also eager to learn more 
about it. It’s much easier than C# and I can’t wait to learn more about web design. I also find it easier to code HTML without watching 
a step-by-step tutorial, so it makes me happy that I understand the basics to it.</p>

<h4>What do you want to change going forward?</h4>

<p>I would want to change my approach and process to the website, I think I don’t make sufficient planning towards the development of my
website. I would want to make more mind-maps and ask myself more questions to improve my process.</p>
