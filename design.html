<h3>Wireframes </h3>

<p>For my wireframes I decided to create a detailed visual representation of how I would want my website to look like. </p>

<h4>Wireframe 1: </h4>
<img src = "Images/Wireframe1.jpg" alt = "Wireframe 1" width="560" height = "400">
<p>I would want to structure my home page like this, with user interface buttons that help the user navigate through the website just 
from clicking. I want to an include an image of myself but Iâ€™m also considering putting a silhouette of myself, like the image portrays. 
I would also want to include a quote about Interactivity just as an icebreaker.</p>

<h4>Wireframe 2: </h4>
<img src = "Images/Wireframe2.jpg" alt = "Wireframe 2" width="560" height = "400">
<p>This is part of the home page. It includes a little overview about myself, my interests, my goals and just some random stuff.</p>

<h4>Wireframe 3: </h4>
<img src = "Images/Wireframe3.jpg" alt = "Wireframe 3" width="560" height = "400">
<p>This is the page that takes the user to the different categories of my portfolio and these will be user interface buttons that will 
take the user to the respective pages with the images and information of my portfolio.</p>

<h4>Wireframe 4:</h4>
<img src = "Images/Wireframe4.jpg" alt = "Wireframe 4" width="560" height = "400">
<p>This is how the portfolio page will look like, it includes images of the work and descriptions of the work.</p>

<h4>Wireframe 5: </h4> 
<img src = "Images/Wireframe5.jpg" alt = "Wireframe 5" width="560" height = "400">
<p>This is how the blog page will look and there will be user interface buttons that will allow the user to choose which blog they 
want to read.</p>

<h4>Wireframe 6: </h4>
<img src = "Images/Wireframe6.jpg" alt = "Wireframe 6" width="560" height = "400">
<p>The essay page is similar to the blogs page.</p>

<h4>Wireframe 7: </h4> 
<img src = "Images/Wireframe7.jpg" alt = "Wireframe 7" width="560" height = "400">
<p>This is the contact page that will include all my necessary details.</p>

<h3>Put in links to websites that are inspirational, and start collecting reference material here:</h3>

<li> <a href = "https://ready.so">Ready.so Website</a> 
<p>I really like the way the text of this website is laid out, as well as the images. 
I drew inspiration from this to make my wireframe for the 'About Me' section. </p> 
<img src = "Images/ReadySo.png" alt="Screenshot of Ready.so website" width = "700" height = "400"> </li>

<li> <a href ="https://www.aprilford.com">April Ford Website</a> 
<p>I used inspiration from this website to position the user interface for the different pages of the 
website at the top left of the website. </p>
<img src = "Images/AprilFord.png" alt = "Screenshot of AprilFord website" width = "700" height = "400"> </li>

<li> <a href = "https://webflow.com" > Web Flow Website</a>
<p>The way the images in this website are positioned, inspired the way I will position my images for the portfolio page. </p>
<img src = "Images/Webflow.png" alt = "Screenshot of WebFlow website" width = "700" height = "400"> 
 
<p>I am thinking of using modern minimalistic fonts such as Montserrat and Jura, to give the website a more clear and crisp appearance, making
it legible.  </p>

<h3>Information Structure:</h3>
