            <h1>Week 13: Relection on the Internet as an Ethical Space</h1>
            <h2>Reflect on the internet as an ethical space: what does it mean to me, what would it look like and what are the challenges we face. </h2>
            <p>Regarding the internet as an ethical space, I thought of the reading we did in Week 8, Internet Access is a Fundamental Right by Spyros Kasapis, 
                that spoke about digital divide. The internet offers vast resources and opportunities, but access is not available to everyone. This creates 
                some form of inequality, well ‘digital inequality’, because some people around the world are unable to access information because of their 
                socioeconomic status, geographic location, or education level, and it impacts people whereas they are unable to access opportunities education, 
                employment and social participation.</p>

            <p>Another worry could be privacy and data security, privacy is a fundamental right, but the internet creates challenges to maintaining personal 
                privacy. Companies and individuals often collect and use people’s personal data without consent, and this creates problems in terns od identity 
                theft, finance scams. Martin and Nissenbaum state that respecting privacy involves adhering to established norms regarding the collection, usage, 
                and sharing of information, while violating privacy entails breaching these norms (Martin, 2016b; Nissenbaum, 2010). </p>

            <p>The internet is a huge digital space and many people have access to it, and in most cases people have the freedom to share and create content and 
                sometimes this creates issues in terms of misinformation. The spread of false information can have serious consequences, like manipulating people’s 
                opinions or creating false views, for example lies about a company’s involvement with socio-political issues such as bribes or termination of crucial 
                incriminating evidence. The ethical use of the internet involves promoting accurate information and combating misinformation. There are many issues 
                relating to ethics on the internet, and these issues require us to adhere to promote fairness, justice, respect in the digital world and legal standards 
                to help make the internet a more safer place. </p>

            <p>My experience on the internet has been a mix of positive and negative encounters. One example is when I saw an ad on Instagram for a promotional offer 
                from KFC. Intrigued by the deal, I clicked on the ad, expecting to be directed to an official KFC page. Instead, I was redirected to a fake website 
                that mimicked KFC's branding and design. </p>

            <p>This experience was concerning to me for many reasons. Firstly, it made me question Instagram's process for advertisements. How could a fraudulent ad 
                bypass their security checks and end up on users' feeds? Secondly, it highlighted the risks users face regarding scams and fraudulent activities online. 
                If I hadn't recognized the fake website, I might have unknowingly shared personal information or financial details, potentially leading to identity theft 
                or financial loss.</p>

            <p>Such incidents show the need for better safeguards and more verification processes for online advertisements. Platforms like Instagram have a responsibility 
                to protect their users by ensuring that the ads they display are legitimate and safe. This experience has made me more cautious about interacting with online 
                ads and more critical of the measures taken by social media platforms to ensure user safety. </p>
