    <h2> Week 8: Blogpost</h2>
    <p> The article I chose to respond to is Internet Access is a Fundamental Right by Spyros Kasapis. The article was written and 
        published during the Covid-19 pandemic and it argues that internet access should be considered a fundamental right.</p>

    <p>The pandemic has highlighted social inequalities, in terms of digital divide, where not everyone has access to the internet. 
    “Digital inequality is a new type of digital divide, that is, the gap between those who participate in the digital age and those 
    who do not.” (Ranchordás,2020). This digital divide was evident in areas such as education where some students where unable to have
    access to remote learning and another could be healthcare, some people were unable to register online for vaccines and general 
    health care tips regarding Covid. In my own experience through the pandemic, I noticed how life was operating through the internet,
    basic interactions were happening through social media and information regarding the pandemic was dominantly shared and distributed 
    online, I couldn’t imagine not having access to those privileges.   </p>

    <p>The article argues that internet access should be considered a human right like other basic human rights such as food, education,
    and healthcare. It emphasizes the important role of the internet in terms of providing access to information, opportunities and 
    general social inclusion. </p>

    <p>I found it interesting how the pandemic caused a fast shift towards a digital economy, where internet access was and is essential
    in the digital economy and how the lack of access to it can be considered as exclusion from economic activities and educational 
    opportunities. In my own experience I noticed how some companies stopped accepting physical cash and lead to only accepting digital 
    transactions such as Electronic funds transfer (EFTs).</p>

    <p>Another article I read was The Need for Global Internet Connectivity by Claire Daniolou. The article discusses the importance of 
    global internet connectivity. It highlights the importance and effects of Broadband. “Communications technologies that provide 
    high-speed, always-on connections to the Internet for large numbers of residential and small-business subscribers are commonly 
    referred to as “broadband” technologies.” (Crandall, 2003). According to the article broadband internet as overcome physical 
    boundaries and connect people, places and businesses globally. It can also help rural communities showcase their uniqueness, 
    cultures and identities to online markets but lack of access can lead to a digital divide. Broadband enables efficient global 
    communication and facilitates the sharing of ideas and experiences; it also plays a crucial part in the business world, whereas 
    it helps businesses thrive, increase profits and improve the quality of engagement between the business and customers. </p>

    <p> Another point mentioned is the dangers and challenges related to broadband and these include:</p>
<ol>
    <li> <p> Misinformation: The internet is filled with information but not all of it is accurate. Examples of these could be rumours 
    and conspiracy theories which can be used to manipulate some of the online communities’ opinions and behaviours.</p></li>
    <li> <p> Promotion of violence and terrorism: Some groups or individuals can use the internet to spread propaganda, recruit new 
    members and plan acts of violence or terrorism.</p></li>
    <li> <p> Social marginalization due to lack of access to the internet: Access to the internet is increasingly important for 
    participation in modern society. Those without it (individuals in rural areas), may face social marginalization as they are not
    able to fully engage and interact in online communication, education, employment opportunities and essential services.</p></li>
</ol>

<p> Another article I read was Fitting the description: historical and sociotechnical elements of facial recognition and anti-black 
surveillance by Damien Patrick Williams. I mainly focused on the section titled: Analog to digital, photography and surveillance.</p>

<p> This section explores the racialized history of photography and surveillance and how biases and discrimination have been presented
in these systems. I found it interesting how racial biases were present in photography. For instance there was a bias towards the 
rendering of images when white peoples’ images were rendered clearly as opposed to darker skin toned peoples’ renders being indistinguishable. 
This disparity shows how photographic technologies were developed to capture and present white faces and neglect accurate representations of 
people of colour.</p>

<p> Another example that further illustrates this bias would be the incident in 2009, where Hewlett-Packard’s motion sensitive digital 
cameras failed to follow black faces, whereas if a white person was present, the cameras would follow the person perfectly, as opposed 
to a black person where the camera would remain stationary, regardless of how the black person moved. This bias shows how the camera 
responded to different racial groups.</p>

<p> These instances highlight how societal racial biases effected photographic and surveillance technologies.</p>
