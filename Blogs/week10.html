            <h1>Week 10: Reflection on chosen reading</h1>

            <p> The selected reading for this week is Digital inequalities and why they matter. I chose this reading because we had a discussion
            in class about the biases that are present in the tech industry and how many people are affected by it. The reading addresses some 
            of the inequalities that are present in the digital world. The reading mentions some of these inequalities which include race, class
            and gender.</p>
            
            <h2> Gender </h2>
            <p> Research in the past focused on identifying the gaps between genders in digital usage but recent studies aim to understand the 
            reasons behind these gaps and their impact on outcomes like social connections, job opportunities and education. In class our lecturer 
            Hanli, mentioned that the workplace tends to be harder for woman and sometimes becomes toxic due to discrimination regarding women 
            capabilities. Another point was about ‘self-perception of skills’ whereas women tend to underestimate their online skills and abilities 
            compared to men, even when skills are objectively similar which can ultimately affect actual online behavior and opportunities. Another 
            point is that men outnumber women in IT development and design roles.</p>

            <h2> Race and Ethnicity</h2>
            <p> This section gave definitions of certain aspects of race and ethnicity like multicultural societies which are places where different 
            social groups, like ethnic and racial minorities, live together. These groups have different positions in society. Digital inequality 
            which is about how different groups access and use technology, the reading also questions whether the use of technology makes social 
            differences smaller or bigger. A student in class mentioned that he engaged with an academic reading that talks about how society 
            favors a specific human identity: the 'straight white male and how usually anyone who does not meet that criteria is automatically 
            deemed as an anomaly. I found this interesting and scary considering the fact that it happens in almost every industry.</p>

            <p>Another point mentioned is about the global perspective that inequalities in internet access make racial and ethnic differences 
            bigger. For example, Africa has fewer internet users compared to its population. Due to cultural differences, different cultures 
            affect how people use technology. Some groups might use it more for content creation while other may use it to spread information. 
            Linking this to our week 9 reading called: Towards a study of information Geographies - Graham, De Sabbata and Zook (2015), information 
            can be altered, shared and processed differently depending on people’s geographical location. With regards to race and ethnicity, African 
            countries have limited access to certain information and knowledge because of their internet access and usage. Our lecturer mentioned 
            that as South Africans, we have more knowledge about wars happening in other countries than the wars or issues in our own country ,and 
            this shows the influence of the countries who have power over ‘information’, whereas they control what is shared and what is ignored. 
            (I hope this makes sense) </p>

            <h2> Health Care </h2>
            <p> ICT (Information and Communication Technology) is changing healthcare, especially in America. Using technology like eHealth, 
            telemedicine and connected health help solve problems in healthcare, whereas it helps people manage their health. With regards to 
            digital inequalities, some people have less access to digital technology and skills, which makes it harder for them using eHealth 
            services such as telemedicine which allows patients to consult with healthcare providers using video calls or messaging apps. 
            Research shows that factors like age, gender, race, education affect who uses eHealth. The example used is the Healthcare.gov 
            website which had problems when it was launched because it had problems. It was hard to use for people with small screens or who 
            weren't good with computers. This shows not everyone can easily use eHealth tools. This example reminds me of our lecturer, Hanli 
            who mentioned the government covid-19 vaccination website, which was not designed well to accommodate multiple devices, which 
            automatically excludes those who do not have access to the devices needed to make the website work properly.</p>

            <h2> Data Collection </h2>
            <p> The way data has been collected has changed so much in the past 20 years. There has been a decline in the engagement of people 
            on surveys over the phone or in person interviews. Web surveys then emerged which made it easier to reach more people, but not 
            everyone had equal access to the internet, and this basically led to those who participated, representing the whole population. 
            Another point was that whether someone responding to a web survey depended on their education, income, and their internet connectivity. 
            People who lived in rural areas often had less access to high-speed internet, so the surveys that rely on the internet may have not 
            represented them well. Social media surveys were then the next solution, but an issue was that usually older people weren’t really 
            on social media which affected who responds to the surveys on social media platforms. An example of this is Facebook and Instagram. 
            More older people tend to use Facebook, while Instagram is more popular among younger users. </p>
