            <h2>Week 2: Blog Post</h2>

            <h3>Discuss your folder structure and URL scheme. Outline your decision-making:</h3>

            <p>At first I had no clue what was meant by the word ‘scheme’ and had no idea what was required from us. I asked a few of my classmates 
                to help and I had a basic understanding of what was required. It’s basically how your website will be stacked in a cupboard and whenever 
                the user needs certain information, the respective folder is pulled from the cupboard.</p>


            <p>Here are my folders:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>index.html = the homepage that will give a little information about the website and about myself</li>
                <li>portfolio.html = the portfolio page will display the work I’ve previously done which I would want to showcase.</li>
                <li>contact.html = the contact page will offer the user my contact details such as my social media accounts, emails and phone numbers.</li>
                <li>blog.html = the blog page will showcase the weekly posts that I’ve done, including additional commentary.</li>
                <li>essays.html = the essays page will showcase essays that will be done throughout the semester.</li>
                <li>Images folder: will contain all the images that will be used in the website, for example images of the portfolio.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>How the URL will potentially look like:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>https://matalame.com</li>
                <li>https://matalame.com/home</li>
                <li>https://matalame.com/portfolio/graphicdesign</li>
                <li>https://matalame.com/portfolio/interiordesign</li>
                <li>https://matalame.com/blogs/week1</li>
                <li>https://matalame.com/contact</li>
                <li>https://matalame.com/about/me</li>
            </ul>


            <p>I think this will help the user know where they are on my website and I learnt from lecture 2 that as the designers we 
                should aim at making the URL’s human readable so it can be simpler to understand and that keeping the URL short makes it easier 
                to share, reduces mental overload, is reliable. Lastly, that we should avoid long strings of numbers or characters, 
                I think this makes the URL harder to understand and more clustered.</p>

            <h3>Put in images of your first wireframe ideas and explain what you are thinking of doing:</h3>

            <p>(My wireframes are in the design section).</p>
    
            <h3>Reflect on Moulthrop, S. (2003) ‘You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media (1991)’: how does it speak to 
                the internet today?</h3>

            <p>Moulthrop seemed to be concerned about the rapid growth of hypertext and how overwhelming it may be. He also reflects on the 
                cyclical nature of technological trends and how hypertext could be temporarily popular. This made me think how technology is 
                rapidly growing and how one technological advancement could be so popular but be replaced by other technological advancement, it makes me 
                question whether they’ll ever be a technological advancement that cannot be surpassed in or if this will be a never ending cycle of 
                constant technological improvements and ideas.</p>  

            <p>The reading also taught me how Hypertext systems utilize the interactive potential of computers to create variable-access databases, 
                allowing any unit of discourse to have multiple associations.</p>
        
            <h3>Reflect on interaction and the www: what does interaction mean to you?</h3>

            <p>Let me start off by mentioning my favorite part about the lecture: “we are in the business of manipulation”. I never thought of how 
                as web designers, we manipulate the user to make certain actions such as clicking on a link on our websites, it made me think of the 
                psychological part of it, and how we should understand our user to ultimately manipulate them.</p>

            <p>Interaction to me is how input leads to output. In order for something to be interactable there has to be an outcome as a result of 
                an input. In web design, I think the interaction can be seen when the user clicks on a user interface element (home button) and 
                it directs the user to the respective page (home page).</p>
        
            <p>The lecture taught me more about interactivity and how it should be responsive and not respond in a completely random fashion. 
                I don’t think I’ve ever thought of how websites are not random, how when you click on the close button, it closes the tab and not shut 
                down the computer.</p>

            <p>I also feel like a huge part of interactivity is ‘feedback’, because feedback allows the user to know that something has happened 
                from something they did, an example of this would be how the light switches on once the laptop charger is switched on.</p>
