            <h3>Towards a study of information Geographies - Graham, De Sabbata and Zook (2015):</h3>

            <p>The reading talks about the geographical aspect of Information. It begins by mentioning that information is always linked to 
            specific places and how it comes from somewhere, relates to certain locations, and cultures. Information is usually shared and 
            distributed, from one place to another, constantly moving and changing. Examples of information can include standard data, stories, 
            and guides. Information is easy to share and also easy to change, and Latour (1986) mentions ‘immutable mobiles’ which are information 
            that stay the same, no matter where they are shared. Graham uses an example of the printing press, whereas once the newspapers were 
            printed, they could not be easily changed or manipulated. </p>

            <p>Immutable mobiles as items that can be moved around the world with unchanging information, can help people understand different 
            locations around the world, and these could be maps, postcards, and tourist guides. A point I found interesting was how once 
            information is printed, it becomes both attached to a physical object (newspaper) and separated from its original location because 
            it can be moved around (the mall), this made me think about how smartphones and the internet work. They take this idea of detachable 
            information even further. With a smartphone, you can access different information from anywhere in the world instantly, you can 
            share and receive information in real-time, regardless of where you are.</p>

            <p>We also get to understand that before computers and the internet, the tools used to gather, store, and share information were limited. 
            The main way that information was stored in the past, was with books, which were to a certain extent limited, they could only hold 
            certain amounts of information and were stored in specific physical spaces. Graham mentions that handling information required specific 
            skills that were learnt in certain places like educational institutions, and this caused people who controlled information to have 
            some form of societal power because most of the information was only accessible to richer countries, leading to poorer countries not 
            having access to that information, in places such as Africa. </p>

            <p>Graham talks about the “information revolution” or the “data revolution” which refers to large amounts of information than there 
            used to be, this was caused by new systems that use technology to share and use information, like computers and the internet. Some 
            people believe that the digital age could change the way information is controlled and used, especially in politics and economics. 
            People have the ability to take part in shaping the information they see and use. Experts like Lawrence Lessig say that the internet 
            gives everyone a better chance to access and contribute to knowledge, no matter where they live. Platforms such as Google and Wikipedia 
            have made it easier for many people to access information. </p>

            <h3>Greenstein et al. - 2018 - How Geography Shapes—and Is Shaped by—the Internet:</h3>

            <p>As people use electronic communication more, like texting or emailing, they rely less on talking face-to-face or using other offline 
            methods. This means they're doing more things digitally, such as shopping online instead of going to stores. With the rise of internet 
            distribution and search, people can buy and find things online, reducing the need for physical transportation of goods or searching in 
            person. Consequently, cities become less crucial because the internet makes it easier to communicate, transport goods, and find what you 
            need without being in a city, reducing the benefits of living in one.</p>

            <p>Another point mentioned is about the adoption of information technology and how it varies across different locations, leading to differences 
            in the reduction of search, distribution, and communication costs. This is because using the internet often requires additional resources 
            like broadband service or expertise in setting up technological systems, and these resources differ from place to place. Not all locations 
            experience the same benefits from internet adoption, as some areas may have better infrastructure or knowledge, resulting in a more significant 
            impact on their communities compared to others. For example, a community equipped with strong internet infrastructure and knowledgeable 
            inhabitants might enjoy considerable advantages from embracing the internet, whereas a community lacking such resources might not witness 
            equivalent transformative effects. </p>

            <p>I found the topic about the consequences of the internet for consumer behaviour. The internet has revolutionized consumer behaviour in 
            many ways, it led to lower prices for goods due to increased competition among online businesses. It also offers a wider selection of products 
            and reduces search costs, making it easier to find exactly what they need. It also grants people the ability to shop from the comfort of their 
            homes. Furthermore, the internet has significantly reduced distribution costs for many goods, particularly those that can be delivered digitally, 
            resulting in more savings for consumers, but certain items like automobiles still caused high distribution costs online.</p>
