            <h2>Week 3: Blogpost</h2>

            <h3>User Alignment:</h3>
            <p>User alignment refers to making sure a website is easy to use and clearly shows what it's meant for. It's about ensuring that 
                the website's goals match what users want, making everything simple and straightforward. It involves ensuring that the design 
                and interface are seamlessly aligned with the user’s expectations, making the overall experience straightforward and user-friendly. 
                Essentially, it's like making sure the website and the user are on the same page and understand each other easily. The target 
                audience makes it easier to consider what the user would expect from the page, for example if the target audience was fitness 
                and health enthusiasts the website would probably have content centred around fitness, health recipes, wellness tips and 
                motivation. It would also feature workout videos, tips and meal-planning tools.</p>

            <p>What about my website?</p>

            <p>My website would be used to showcase and promote my portfolio and my target audience will be potential employers or potential 
                collaborators for passion projects. I want my website to be easy to use by including the necessary input controls such as links, 
                this ensures that navigating through my portfolio is straightforward, enabling visitors, especially my target audience to easily 
                access and explore my showcased work. The intention with regards to the user is to create a seamless and intuitive experience 
                that effectively communicates my skills and expertise to users especially those with my shared interests.</p>

            <h3>User Experience:</h3>

            <p>This refers to what users feel when they interact with the website. I would start off with the information structure and determine 
                what content goes with another and where it will be positioned. Then determine the options the user has at each point, if it’s the
                page for my blogs, the user should be able to access any blog post at any time. From the lecture I learnt how user experience 
                considers many types of users, for example users with bad connection speeds, will the website offer text to represent the images? 
                Another example would be users who are color blind, will the website has a feature that is capable of adjusting colors to 
                be user-friendly for those who are color blind. Another thing I would want my website to have is feedback, to help the 
                user know what results are caused by their input, for example interactive elements like buttons changing color to 
                acknowledge user interactions, providing visual feedback. Another example would be load spinners or progress bars, when my 
                website is processing a request or loading images, the spinners will represent the action of loading which gives the user 
                feedback about that process.</p>

            <h3>Interface Elements:</h3>

            <p>User interface elements are necessary when a decision needs to be made and it must be represented in the interface to the system, 
                for example a ‘BUY’ button on an online shoe store.</p>
            <ul> 
                <li>Input Controls: For my website I want to include buttons that will each contain minimal information about a specific artwork 
                until they click and are then presented with more information.</li>
                <li>Navigational Components: For the navigation I would want to include a breadcrumb, which would help users move between different 
                pages effectively.</li>
                <li>Informational Components: this section I would want to include message boxes, in this case I want to use the message boxes in 
                a funny way by giving random facts about myself and this will kinda show my personality. For example: “I like cars, and if the economy 
                allowed, I would want to have eight of them”.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Reflect on how the exercise above relates to what you know about your structure and URL scheme, and how it relates to semantic markup.</h3>

            <p>These exercises made me think of the amount of planning that goes into the structure of a website. It made me think of how important the user 
                is and how much of a priority they are. In terms of the URL scheme, it should be easy to read and help the user know at where they are on the website.</p>
            <p>With regards to how it relates to semantic markup, semantic markup is defined as the use of markup language such as HTML to convey information 
                about the meaning of each element in a document through proper selection of markup elements to maintain complete separation between the markup and 
                the visual presentation of the elements contained in the document. This definition makes me see the importance of using the correct elements to 
                structure your website and these could ultimately affect the user experience if they are used incorrectly and they could also affect the way the 
                intended goal of the website is, for example if the wrong elements were used the structure of the website could be incomplete or different.</p>

            <h3>Reflect on your development progress for the week.</h3>

            <p>I went through the lectures Lucky taught and I got to understand the importance of semantic markup, and how each tag has a significant use 
                in the code, I won’t lie the tag 'div' and 'span' are still foreign to me and I still don’t fully understand them. I do understand that 'div' 
                renders in blocks while 'span' renders in a line, for example if you’re adding a link in a sentence. The lecture also taught me cool Google 
                Chrome developer tools, It was fun playing around with the Wits website and getting to understand HTML through existing websites on the internet. 
                This week I aimed at fixing my code and trying to implement the semantic markup, by using the correct tags so the console or ‘bot’ understand what 
                I want my website to look like. I also learnt a lot about UI and UX and how they work together to ensure that the website is easy to use for the user.</p>
