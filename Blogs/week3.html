    <h2>Week 3: Blogpost</h2>
<h3>User Alignment:</h3>

<p>User alignment refers to making sure a website is easy to use and clearly shows what it's meant for. It's about ensuring that the 
website's goals match what users want, making everything simple and straightforward. It involves ensuring that the design and 
interface are seamlessly aligned with the user’s expectations, making the overall experience straightforward and user-friendly.  
Essentially, it's like making sure the website and the user are on the same page and understand each other easily. The target audience 
makes it easier to consider what the user would expect from the page, for example if the target audience was fitness and health 
enthusiasts the website would probably have content centred around fitness, health recipes, wellness tips and motivation. It would also 
feature workout videos, tips and meal-planning tools.</p>

<p>What about my website?</p>

<p>My website would be used to showcase and promote my portfolio and my target audience will be potential employers or potential 
collaborators for passion projects. I want my website to be easy to use by including the necessary input controls such as links, 
this ensures that navigating through my portfolio is straightforward, enabling visitors, especially my target audience to easily 
access and explore my showcased work. The intention with regards to the user is to create a seamless and intuitive experience that 
effectively communicates my skills and expertise to users especially those with my shared interests.</p>

<h3>User Experience:</h3>

<p>This refers to what users feel when they interact with the website. I would start off with the information structure and determine 
what content goes with another and where it will be positioned. Then determine the options the user has at each point, if it’s the page 
for my blogs, the user should be able to access any blog post at any time. From the lecture I learnt how user experience considers many 
types of users, for example users with bad connection speeds, will the website offer text to represent the images? Another example would
be users who are colour blind, will the website has a feature that is capable of adjusting colours to be user-friendly for those who 
are colour blind. Another thing I would want my website to have is feedback, to help the user know what results are caused by their 
input, for example interactive elements like buttons changing colour to acknowledge user interactions, providing visual feedback. 
Another example would be load spinners or progress bars, when my website is processing a request or loading images, the spinners will 
represent the action of loading which gives the user feedback about that process.</p>

<h3>Interface Elements: </h3>

<p>User interface elements are necessary when a decision needs to be made and it must be represented in the interface to the system, 
for example a ‘BUY’ button on a online shoe store.</p>

<p>Input Controls: For my website I want to include buttons that will each contain minimal information about a specific artwork until 
they click and are then presented with more information.</p>

<p>Navigational Components: For the navigation I would want to include a breadcrumb, which would help users move between different 
pages effectively. </p> 

<p>Informational Components: this section I would want to include message boxes, in this case I want to use the message boxes in a 
funny way by giving random facts about myself and this will kinda show my personality. For example: “I like cars, and if the economy 
allowed, I would want to have eight of them”. </p>  

<h3>Reflect on how the exercise above relates to what you know about your structure and URL scheme, and how it relates to 
semantic markup.</h3>

<p>These exercises made me think of the amount of planning that goes into the structure of a website. It made me think of how important
the user is and how much of a priority they are. In terms of the URL scheme, it should be easy to read and help the user know at where 
they are on the website.</p>

<p>With regards to how it relates to semantic markup, semantic markup is defined as the use of markup language such as HTML to convey 
information about the meaning of each element in a document through proper selection of markup elements to maintain complete separation 
between the markup and the visual presentation of the elements contained in the document. This definition makes me see the importance 
of using the correct elements to structure your website and these could ultimately affect the user experience if they are used 
incorrectly and they could also affect the way the intended goal of the website is, for example if the wrong elements were used the 
structure of the website could be incomplete or different.</p>

<h3>Reflect on your development progress for the week. </h3>
<p>I went through the lectures Lucky taught and I got to understand the importance of semantic markup, and how each tag has a 
significant use in the code, I won’t lie the tag 'div' and 'span' are still foreign to me and I still don’t fully 
understand them. I do understand that 'div' renders in blocks while 'span' renders in a line, for example if you’re adding 
a link in a sentence. The lecture also taught me cool Google Chrome developer tools, It was fun playing around with the Wits website 
and getting to understand HTML through existing websites on the internet. This week I aimed at fixing my code and trying to implement 
the semantic markup, by using the correct tags so the console or ‘bot’ understand what I want my website to look like. I also learnt 
a lot about UI and UX and how they work together to ensure that the website is easy to use for the user.</p>
