            <h1>Week 4: IxD Process and Reflection</h1>

            <h2>Goal Alignment:</h2>
            <p>My goal is to present a functional and user-friendly website that showcases my art and work completed throughout the semester. 
            I want the website to reflect my personality and let users know who it's about.</p>
  
            <h2>Information Structure:</h2>
            <img src="../Images/InformationStructure.png" alt="Information structure diagram" width="500" height="400">
       
            <h2>User Flow:</h2>
            <img src="../Images/UserFlow.jpg" alt="User Flow Diagram" width="500" height="400">

            <h2>Interface Elements:</h2>
            <p>In my week 3 blog post, I mentioned the interface elements I would use:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Input Controls: buttons</li>
                <li>Navigational Components: breadcrumb</li>
                <li>Informational Components: message boxes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I've also considered how shapes can influence the tone of the website. I'll use rectangular buttons with smooth/circular 
            edges for a neutral tone.</p>
  
            <h2>Design - Style Guide & Wireframes:</h2>
            <p>My wireframes remain unchanged, with minor adjustments for interface shapes. The aesthetic will stay minimalistic with 
            modern fonts and neutral colors.</p>
   
            <h2>Reflection on Original Wireframes:</h2>
            <p>My wireframes include elements that may require CSS and JavaScript knowledge to execute.</p>

            <h2>Reflection on Website Work:</h2>
            <p>I initially struggled with understanding HTML basics but found resources like MDN helpful. I'm proud of taking Interactive 
            Media seriously and enjoy learning web design.</p>
   
            <h2>What I'm Proud of:</h2>
            <p>I'm proud of taking Interactive Media seriously and enjoying learning web design. I also find HTML coding easier without 
            step-by-step tutorials.</p>
     
            <h2>Changes Going Forward:</h2>
            <p>I want to improve my website development process by making more mind maps and asking more questions to refine my approach.</p>
