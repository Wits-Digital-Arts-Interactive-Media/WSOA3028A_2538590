            <h2>Lecture Notes</h2>
            <h3> JavaScript Fundamentals Part 1: </h3>
            
            <p> It's a dynamic language, it's interpreted them complied, then executed. These languages are designed for human beings.</p>
            <p>Rule 1: Don't break the internet!</p>
            <P> Consider 'Type Coercion': it's going to try to figure out, based on the stuff you give it what the best possible type is it for that thing</P>
            <p>It's a asynchronicity language, its more efficient because it only has one thread, whenever a function is called it puts it at the end of the heap
            whenever a function is called it puts it at the end of the heap, and constantly runs through all these things. </p>
            <p> Scope: if you use 'this' to your local context of either the function you're executing in, the class you're executing in or the module 
            in JavaScript you can refer to 'this' into anything you want. </p>

            <h3> There are three variables: </h3>
                <ul> 
                   <li> Var - old school variable, gets assigned as a global state. Mike: "DON'T USE IT"</li>
                   <li> let - modern 'var', you can't refine 'let' </li> 
                   <li> const - you can only assign those variables once, you can't redifine them</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>There are 8 types of data types: </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> Numbers: An integer or floating point number. E.g 42 or 4.14160</li>
                    <li> Boolean: True or False </li>
                    <li> null: a special keyboard denoting a null value because JS is case- sensitive</li>
                    <li> undefined: a top-level property whose value is not defined </li>
                    <li> BigInt: an integer with arbitary precision. E.g 9000365786798n </li>
                    <li> String: a sequence of characters that represent a text value. E.g "Howdy"</li>
                    <li> Symbol: A data type whose instances are unique and immutable. </li>
                </ul>
            <h3> Falsey values:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> false </li>
                    <li> null </li>
                    <li> undefined </li>
                    <li> 0 </li>
                    <li> "" - Empty String </li>
                    <li> [] - Empty Array </li>
                    <li> '=' - an assignment, setting the one to the another</li>
                    <li> '==' - a coersive quality, it's going to try to find what the best type difference between those two things is</li>
                    <li> '===' - comparison : you can't use them with 'object'</li>
                </ul>

            <h3> Functions:</h3>
            <p> functions are essentially tiny bits of code that we know we are going to use over and over again, instead of copying and 
            pasting that code, we instead create a function we can simply call. </p>

            <h3> Objects: </h3>
            <p> a collection of related data, which usually consists of similar variables and functions. Functions that are a part of the object
            are called 'methods'</p>

            <h3> The difference between undefined and null: </h3>
            <p>' undefined means that this thing has not yet been assigned, basically we've created this thing in memory but its not actually 
            pointing to anything' </p>

            <h3> Classes: </h3>
            <p> its like a blueprint of what an object will look like, then we crease instance s of that class.</p>

            <h3> Recorded lecture: Internet, Society, and Design Justice </h3>

            <p> The image shows a full body scan. That presents two buttons: pink and blue, that help distinguish between male and female.
            In the past the renders of the full body scans were explicit, making it a very invasive design. It dismisses people in the margins.
            Its designed for a particular type of person.</p>
            <p> Hanli: 'Design here is not simply aesthetics for UI, it is system design, graphic design, UI and the interaction of how these
            things relate.'</p>
            <p>The Design Justice Network principles sees the design as something that should deeply be 'community involved' and argues that 
            they aren't an expert on the society group they designing for.</p>
            <p> 'Design is collaborative' </p>
            <p> Questions to ask: Did you see what's alreadu in place? What's already working? What was the engagement with the people you are 
            designing for?</p>
            <p> People from the margins often reproduce, replicate and act in the same notion of validity. Its to establish new validities.</p>

            <h3>Website Fundamentals: Making your URLs more usable</h3>

            <p> Keeping your URLs humen readable for simpler conveyance of information with uRLs.Keeping your URLs short for easier sharing, 
            reducing mental overload, greater reliability and avoid giant long strings of number or characters </p>

            <h3> Dates: </h3>
            <p> Many people communicate data publication by using a top-level structure that starts with a date</p>
            <p> /YYYY /MM/OD / - order of hierarchical signiticance</p>
            <p> /YYYY / 00D / - 150 ordinal date order, saves to characters (shorter is better, though may not be immediately understood by 
            readers) and communicates linearity to your year of posts.</p>

            <h3> Parsing:</h3>
            <p> Once the browser receives the first chunk of data, it can begin parsing the information received. Parsing is the step the 
            browser takes to turn</p>

            <h3> The DOM: </h3>
            <p> The data it receives over the network into the DOM and essoM, whieh is used by the renderer to paint a page to the screen. </p>
            <p> The DOM is the internal representation of the markup for the browser.</p>
            <p> The DOM is also exposed and can be manipulated through various APls in Javascript: </p>
            <p> Even if the requested page's HTML is larger than the intial 14 KB packet, the branser will begin parsing and attempting 
            to render an experience based</p>
            <p> On the data it has. This is why it's important for web performance optimization to include everything the browser needs to 
            start rendering a page, or at least a template of the page - the css and HTML needed for the first render - in the first 14KB. 
            But before anything is rendered to the screen, the HTML, CSS and JavaScript have to be parsed.</p>
