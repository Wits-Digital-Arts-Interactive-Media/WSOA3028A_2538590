            <h1>Week 11: JavaScript Reflection</h1>
            <h2>What changes have I made to my website to incorporate JavaScript?</h2>
            <p> When I went through the JavaScript lectures, I found how flexible JavaScript is compared to HTML. There were new things to 
            learn and I would’ve wanted to incorporate much more but I was limited because most of the resources from YouTube and dev websites 
            used CSS which was not required in website 2.</p>

            <p>I faced a problem with the menu page, my website navigation was working and for some reason stopped working the day before 
            submission. Through the help of my peers, we saw the problem came from where the folder was located, it was located within the
            OneDrive cloud, which created a long path that GitHub was struggling to find, but once we moved the project to the :C drive, 
            the path was easier to find. </p>

            <p>Menu: Hanli provided us with a script that helped instantiate menu components into our nav tag. The script included the 
            different pages present in the website which were: Home, Blogs, Design, Portfolio and ‘About Me’.</p>

            <p>Text Hover: For the blog page menu that included the navigation for the different weeks, whenever the user hovers over the 
            text it changes to upper case from lower case.</p>

            <p>Random Fact Generator: On the ‘About Me’ page there’s a button that generates random strings that contain information about 
            me for example “I am a car guy” or “I am a student at the University of Witwatersrand”.</p>

            <p>Image Carousel or Slideshow: On the portfolio page, there’s a section that allows the user to change in-between images, using 
            the ‘next’ and ‘previous’ buttons.</p>

            <p>Back-to-top button: At the bottom of the pages (footer), once the user is done engaging with the content, they can press the
            ‘back to top’ button to navigate back to the header of the page.</p>

            <h2>How does that help you streamline your interaction design?</h2>

            <p>Regarding my user flow there is a smooth and intuitive navigation, that allows the user to make their way through the website, 
            deciding which page they would want to go to or back to, without receiving 404 errors, or wrong links to wrong pages. Regarding 
            the wireframes, I added new wireframes with the potential colour scheme I would want to use. It would be better to use CSS to 
            execute the wireframes. Then with feedback and response, there’s feedback that is present in the interface buttons, that show the 
            user the output of the input they put in, for example pressing the ‘Generate facts’ button, that offers a new string each time its 
            pressed. Lastly, consistency. There’s a ‘back to top’ button on every page that has a lot of content and a lot of scrolling to do. 
            Another form of consistency would be the navigation present on the website, that allows users to navigate through their desired page.</p>
