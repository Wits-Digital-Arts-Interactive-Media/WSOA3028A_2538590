            <h1>Week 1: Information Synthesis and Research</h1>

            <h2>My experience setting up GitHub and publishing to Pages:</h2>
            <p>Setting up GitHub wasn't much of a challenge. We had a basic understanding of the application and its functions, but it 
                was confusing when it was time to link GitHub to Visual Studio Code. I experienced problems when I was unaware that Visual 
                Studio doesn't automatically save the changes you make to the script, such as 'comments', which then made it hard to 
                publish the page through GitHub. I do believe that through practice, it will get easier to implement.</p>

            <h2>Reflection on the readings I selected, relating it to my experience with the internet today:</h2>
            <p>The readings I engaged with were "What Hypertext Is" by Noah Wardrip-Fruin and "As We May Think" by Vannevar Bush. Regarding
                "What Hypertext Is", I grasped a basic understanding of what hypertext is using a definition by Marie Laure Ryan: "In 
                hypertext, the reader determines the unfolding of the text by clicking on certain areas, the so-called hyperlinks, that 
                bring to the screen other segments of text." This definition got me to understand how interactivity deals with links, how 
                one component is connected to another component, for example, how the link to a published scholarly essay will direct you 
                to a website that contains the PDF version of the essay where users can view and read the text. The reading also got me to
                learn about hypermedia, which are branches and presentations that respond to user actions and how they are systems of 
                prearranged words and pictures, which can be freely explored.</p>

            <p>The thing that caught my attention in "As We May Think" was how the text focused on the anticipation and vision of the 
                technological devices we have today. It made me understand the limitations that people had before these advancements, for 
                example, how people had to store information in books in organized and systematic ways that were time-consuming and 
                inefficient compared to the rapid technology we share today that allows users to efficiently locate information from vast 
                sets of data. Instead of going to the library, we can access a digital library through a website such as Google Scholar to 
                be able to read the same information that is present in physical books. The reading also allowed me to understand the 
                concept of Memex, although I don't have a solid understanding of the concept, I understand how it is essentially a private 
                file or library for individual use. It allows users to store various materials such as records and personal notes and 
                offers them easy access to it. I think of Memex as a house for the user, where they can place their information in 
                different rooms of the house and arrange them in any way they want.</p>

            <h2>Interesting things I found about the history of the web:</h2>
            <p>The thing I found interesting was how outdated devices such as dry photography and microphotography were once the most 
                reliable and efficient devices to capture and store information. I was fascinated by how the passage "As We May Think" 
                envisioned most of the devices we have today, for example, a system where researchers can talk directly to a machine that 
                types their spoken words. This just made me think of Siri and how this virtual assistant collects the information of the 
                user and presents it in a convenient way to the user, for example: "Hey Siri, what does interactivity mean?" and Siri will 
                respond by reading the most common and popular definition on the internet. This made me appreciate the technology we have 
                because it was a vision for someone and a reality for us.</p>

            <h2>My goals for this course:</h2>
            <p>I have had a bit of experience with websites but only through the use of the web design software called Wix. Making 
                websites using that software made me consider so many components of a website that I did not really find significant, 
                for example, interface buttons that help you navigate from one page of the website to another. This exposure made me want 
                to learn more about web design and what goes into it to make it successful. My goals for the course are to learn how to 
                create websites from scratch and to gain fundamental knowledge and skills required to understand web design and how to 
                make it easy and efficient for the user.</p>
