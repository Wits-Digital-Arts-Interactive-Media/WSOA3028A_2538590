            <h1>Week 12: Reflection on CSS, HTML and JAVASCRIPT</h1>
            <h2>How your CSS relates to the HTML and JS: </h2>
            <h3>CSS: </h3>
            <p> CSS is a tool for that will help me implement the visual design of the website based on the wireframes I created during the 
                design phase. It allows me to move from the static design in HTML to more dynamic web elements, ensuring that the visual impact matches 
                my creative vision. CSS also allows me apply colours, layouts, fonts, and transitions, all that contribute to the aesthetic and user interaction 
                of the website.</p>

            <h2>Roles of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS: </h2>
            <p> HTML: is the backbone of any web page. It provides the structural framework, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, links, 
                and other content, which are essential for the web document.</p>
            <p> JavaScript: is the behaviour of the web, responsible for the interactive elements of the website. JavaScript handles 
                tasks such as handling user inputs, sending requests to servers, and manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model) in real-time, 
                which enhances the user experience by making the website responsive and interactive. </p>
            <p> CSS: takes care of the visual and aesthetic aspects of websites. It styles the HTML content, ensuring that the website's look 
                and feel align with user expectations and design standards. It controls everything from typography to colour schemes, layout 
                configurations, and animations.</p>
            
            <h2>CSS enhancing the User experience: </h2>
            <p> CSS influences user experience by improving the usability and accessibility of the website. Good websites can guide users 
                naturally through the interface, improving their overall interaction and satisfaction. </p>
            
            <h2>The benefits and challenges of responsive design: </h2>
            <h3>Benefits: </h3>
            <p>Improved User Experience: Responsive design adapts the layout of a website according to the screen size and orientation of the device being used. 
                This enhances the user experience by ensuring that content is always readable and that the navigation remains easy, regardless of device.</p>
            <p> SEO Advantages: Search engines favour mobile-friendly websites. Responsive design is a significant factor in SEO strategies because it helps 
                improve the rankings in search engine results, making websites more visible and likely to attract more traffic.</p>

            <h3>Challenges of Responsive Design: </h3>
            <p> Complex development process: Designing a website that functions well on various devices involves more complicated development processes. 
                Developers must consider various factors like different screen sizes, resolutions, and device capabilities.</p>
            <p> Design Limitations: Responsive design sometimes forces designers to compromise on certain creative elements to ensure functionality across 
                all devices.  </p>

            <h2> When thinking about how our code matters in as decolonialism, can you identify any things in your own coding practice that you should be aware of?</h2>
            <p> Addressing decolonialism in the context of coding and the tech world would require us to reflect on how technology, can maintain or challenge existing 
                power structures and biases. In the tech industry, this would mean examining how our code and websites impact different communities and taking active 
                steps to prevent the reinforcement of colonialist attitudes and inequalities. In the tech world I think people should be educated and aware about the 
                multiple perspectives that should be considered in the development process. The design teams should also be diverse so different cultures, experiences 
                and history can be considered so marginalized groups aren’t discriminated against or excluded. In most cases there’s a ‘default’ user that is preferred 
                and this alienates users that are outside that identification. As a designer I would consider the different groups of people relating to race, sexuality, 
                religion, culture, history, background, etc., to try to make my code accommodate for everyone and not leave people excluded. </p>
