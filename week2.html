    <h2>Week 2: Blog Post</h2>
    
    <h3> Discuss your folder structure and URL scheme. Outline your decision-making:</h3>

    <p> At first I had no clue what was meant by the word ‘scheme’ and had no idea what was required from us. I asked a few of my classmates 
        to help and I had a basic understanding of what was required. It’s basically how your website will be stacked in a cupboard and whenever 
        the user needs certain information, the respective folder is pulled from the cupboard.</p>
       
    <p> Here are my folders:</p>

    <li>index.html = the homepage that will give a little information about the website and about myself </li>
    <li>portfolio.html = the portfolio page will display the work I’ve previously done which I would want to showcase.</li>
    <li>contact.html = the contact page will offer the user my contact details such as my social media accounts, emails and phone numbers.</li>
    <li>blog.html = the blog page will showcase the weekly posts that I’ve done, including additional commentary.</li>
    <li>essays.html = the essays page will showcase essays that will be done throughout the semester.</li>
    <li>Images folder: will contain all the images that will be used in the website, for example images of the portfolio.</li>

    <p>How the URL will potentially look like:</p>

    <li> https://matalame.com </li>
    <li> https://matalame.com/home </li>
    <li> https://matalame.com/portfolio/graphicdesign </li>
    <li> https://matalame.com/portfolio/interiordesign </li>
    <li> https://matalame.com/blogs/week1 </li>
    <li> https://matalame.com/contact </li>
    <li> https://matalame.com/about/me </li>


<p>I think this will help the user know where they are on my website and I learnt from lecture 2 that as the designers we 
    should aim at making the URL’s human readable so it can be simpler to understand and that keeping the URL short makes it easier 
    to share, reduces mental overload, is reliable. Lastly, that we should avoid long strings of numbers or characters, 
    I think this makes the URL harder to understand and more clustered. </p>

<h3>Put in images of your first wireframe ideas and explain what you are thinking of doing: </h3>

<p>For my wireframes I decided to create a detailed visual representation of how I would want my website to look like. </p>

<h4>Wireframe 1: </h4>
<img src = "Images/Wireframe1.jpg" width="560" height = "400">
<p>I would want to structure my home page like this, with user interface buttons that help the user navigate through the website just 
from clicking. I want to an include an image of myself but I’m also considering putting a silhouette of myself, like the image portrays. 
I would also want to include a quote about Interactivity just as an icebreaker.</p>

<h4>Wireframe 2: </h4>
<img src = "Images/Wireframe2.jpg" width="560" height = "400">
<p>This is part of the home page. It includes a little overview about myself, my interests, my goals and just some random stuff.</p>

<h4>Wireframe 3: </h4>
<img src = "Images/Wireframe3.jpg" width="560" height = "400">
<p>This is the page that takes the user to the different categories of my portfolio and these will be user interface buttons that will 
take the user to the respective pages with the images and information of my portfolio.</p>

<h4>Wireframe 4:</h4>
<img src = "Images/Wireframe4.jpg" width="560" height = "400">
<p>This is how the portfolio page will look like, it includes images of the work and descriptions of the work.</p>

<h4>Wireframe 5: </h4> 
<img src = "Images/Wireframe5.jpg" width="560" height = "400">
<p>This is how the blog page will look and there will be user interface buttons that will allow the user to choose which blog they 
want to read.</p>

<h4>Wireframe 6: </h4>
<img src = "Images/Wireframe6.jpg" width="560" height = "400">
<p>The essay page is similar to the blogs page.</p>

<h4>Wireframe 7: </h4> 
<img src = "Images/Wireframe7.jpg" width="560" height = "400">
<p>This is the contact page that will include all my necessary details.</p>

<h3>Put in links to websites that are inspirational, and start collecting reference material here:</h3>

<li> <a href = "https://ready.so">Ready.so Website</a> 
<p>I really like the way the text of this website is laid out, as well as the images. 
I drew inspiration from this to make my wireframe for the ’ About Me’ section. </p> 
<img src = "Images/ReadySo.png" alt="Screenshot of Ready.so website" width = "700" height = "400"> </li>

<li> <a href ="https://www.aprilford.com">April Ford Website</a> 
<p>I used inspiration from this website to position the user interface for the different pages of the 
website at the top left of the website. </p>
<img src = "Images/AprilFord.png" alt = "Screenshot of AprilFord website" width = "700" height = "400"> </li>

<li> <a href = "https://webflow.com" > Web Flow Website</a>
<p>The way the images in this website are positioned, inspired the way I will position my images for the portfolio page. </p>
<img src = "Images/Webflow.png" alt = "Screenshot of WebFlow website" width = "700" height = "400"> 
 
<p>I am thinking of using modern minimalistic fonts such as Montserrat and Jura, to give the website a more clear and crisp appearance, making
it legible.  </p>

<h3>Reflect on Moulthrop, S. (2003) ‘You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media (1991)’: how does it speak to 
    the internet today?</h3>

<p>Moulthrop seemed to be concerned about the rapid growth of hypertext and how overwhelming it may be. He also reflects on the 
cyclical nature of technological trends and how hypertext could be temporarily popular. This made me think how technology is rapidly 
growing and how one technological advancement could be so popular but be replaced by other technological advancement, it makes me 
question whether they’ll ever be a technological advancement that cannot be surpassed in or if this will be a never ending cycle of 
constant technological improvements and ideas.</p>  

<p>The reading also taught me how Hypertext systems utilize the interactive potential of computers to create variable- access databases, 
allowing any unit of discourse to have multiple associations.</p>

 
<h3>Reflect on interaction and the www: what does interaction mean to you?</h3>

<p>Let me start of by mentioning my favourite part about the lecture: “we are in the business of manipulation”. I never thought of how 
as web designers, we manipulate the user to make certain actions such as clicking on a link on our websites, it made me think of the 
psychological part of it, and how we should understand our user to ultimately manipulate them. </p>

<p>Interaction to me is how input leads to output. In order for something to be interactable there has to be an outcome as a result of 
an input. In web design, I think the interaction can be seen when the user clickson a user interface element (home button) and 
it directs the user to the respective page (home page). </p>
 
<p>The lecture taught me more about interactivity and how it should be responsive and not respond in a completely random fashion. 
I don’t think I’ve ever thought of how websites are not random, how when you click on the close button, it closes the tab and not shut 
down the computer. </p>

<p>I also feel like a huge part of interactivity is ‘feedback’, because feedback allows the user to know that something has happened 
from something they did, an example of this would be how the light switches on once the laptop charger is switched on.</p>
